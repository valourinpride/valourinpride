Pets are basically living beings other then humans like animals, insects, etc which us humans when felt ownership get or buy them from someone or through stores afterwards if the owner have ethics and responsibilty then that person usually take care off them in home or anywhere else for personal or commercial purposes by providing them overall well being like roof I mean home to live with food and safety at the same making as well as showing bond to build trust and friendship even treat like a family member which will eventually give good and acceptable physical and mental environment for pets, isn't that right?

  

Usually, people who like or love pets only take care of them or else they'll be part of this amazing nature with variety of trees, plants, rivers, oceans etc where they learn to survive and live together in which we since ancient times already constructed homes and buildings for various reasons so now animals are part of them living in various ways among us though animals or whatever creatures are totally capable of living on their own but unfortunately due to our heavy interference with nature they are now struggling to make it out which is dissapointing right? as living being helping fellow living beings is necessary to make a better place, world and the universe.

  

Eventhough human beings can't cope up with all animals atleast as of 21st century on planet earth as a lot of them are quite dangerous and not useful as well but there are many animals which are super useful for daily lifestyle of humans and living with them is not risky like for Instance dogs evolution of foxes, cats, birds, fishes etc they listen to humans and can be trained extensively to do various different tasks effectively and efficiently at first humans mainly used them for hunting but now they are mostly used by law enforcements for investigation in certain cases and as mate by general people to end up loneliness by sharing thoughts and playing games etc.

  

In sense developing a hostile environment for all living beings is must and important for a peaceful and wonderful planet though knowingly or unknowingly for whatever reasons or purposes a lot of people are very much personally taking caring about certain animal and creatures but thing is there is large percentage of animals which are not cared by people and left alone in this human made artificial incompatible harsh environment which is not originally designed for all of us like for instance vehicles and factories based bad air and sound pollution is quite negetively effecting health of many living beings.

  

When animals and other creatures are not in their own habitat it will cause number of issues mainly for people which is why either people have to put them at their right place or learn to live and take care of them but thing is as said earlier now a days a lot of animals are not cared and I'll treated even tortured by people which is wrong as ethical treatment of animals is must and important that even voilates laws though there are some organizations and NGOs like red cross and peta who try their best to take care and protect animals but thing is at the end until or unless there is change in thinking perspective of people saving animals is completely not possible.

  

The best example is dogs which are left alone in urban areas or villages in between homes and buildings known as street dogs they super struggle to find roof, food and water to live well due to lack of proper conditions they get many diseases and they are I'll treated and tortured by some people including that many street dogs slip into accidents from vehicles yet no one do care much about them except some kind people and NGOs due to lack of care and training street dogs eventually will become mad and attack animals or people of any age whoever they see which will end up causing serious problems, bites, injuries that may cause rabies or death so always deal street dogs very carefully.

  

Why do street dogs behave in that way have you ever thought? we know dogs are considered as pets they are popularly known for skills, effection and loyalty towards its owners which is why they are considered as humans best mate and used for protection of you and whatever place or home right? the reason is dogs are evolution of foxes back in early era they like most animals used to hunt other animals to survive so whenever they see a new or unknown living being the first instinct they get is to give warning by barking or do small or big attack which is sometimes deadly that doesn't mean they are bad according to them they are totally right but what's wrong here is we humans haven't properly cared them and put them in right habitat where they can live well.

  

It's simple to say we have to care about animals and street dogs but its not possible for everyone to put it in action based on their current situation and preferences for sure as maintaining and being owner of an animal is not easy for instance in case of dogs it takes a lot of time and money for maintenance and food expensives etc when you don't care about them they may not feel well which is why a lot of people step back and stop thinking about becoming owner of animal as it may end up both in consequences but out of them many have interest and urge so they find ways to fullfill in that process thanks to latest technologies they are able to see and use robotic and digital pets on go.

  

Robotic pets aren't real but physical ones made up of hardware and software components which you can also say toys they are shaped as pets and integrated with various technologies mainly AI aka Artificial intelligence with automated sensors and behavious so that it will behave like a dog according to the customers developing feeling that is real pet though in reality it's not which is quite awesome but thing is modern robotic pets are expensive and they are not easy to carry everywhere including that they have number of drawbacks which is why many people like and prefer digital pets through softwares they are accessible anywhere and anytime from electronic gadgets like PCs and smartphones very easily.

  

Nowadays, digital pet softwares are trending as they are fun and simple to setup many people especially kids and teens going after them though they don't give accurate feeling of having a real pet when you're aware of digital technologies but atleast it's good for kids and those who want to crunch up time or learn how to generally behave and maintain with pets at present there are so many digital pet platforms but thing is most of them are basic and you may not find something new so if you don't choose right interesting one you may end up getting bored for sure.
