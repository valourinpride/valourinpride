Business and enterprise communications are something that needs privacy so they try to maintain secrecy using apps which protect thier data perfectly but still there are some people who own businesses & enterprises don't care about privacy and that leads to usage of apps which don't protect user data in military grade level.

  

We have numerous messaging apps that provide higher standards of security with different privacy policies & T&C for every one including bussines & enterprise like whatsapp, facebook etc but the problem with most messaging apps was they do not guarantee uptime some even don't specify which technology they used to protect data to provide privacy.

  

In this scenario, we have a workaround we found a reliable messaging app named StarLeaf that provide cleaner experience for calling, messaging and meeting to bring people together on any device, so do you like it? are you interested in StarLeaf? If yes let's know little more info about it before we sign up and explore more.

  

In StarLeaf, you can bring teams of all sizes and collaborate with them from home or office to start conversations and even share your screen or files securely with industry leading 99% uptime of SLA that keeps every one connected without disruption and ISO/IEC 27001 provides top standards of data security to protect calls and messages with a data jurisdiction guarantee to control your data or help you maintain compliance.
