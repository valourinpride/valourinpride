In this modern world, there are many digital technologies available on number of electronic devices like computers which later evolved to personal computers and laptops that are Integrated with numerous advanced operating systems basically digital softwares to name few Windows and Mac OS where since long time people have to use physical qwerty keyboard to enter or remove texts etc on operating system available on computers.

  

Majority of people used to consider physical qwerty keyboard as user friendly because you just have to connect computer to start typing easily and as time goes now we have wireless physical qwerty keyboard that's amazing isn't? but not everyone like to use physical qwerty keyboard for various reasons mainly because physical qwerty keyboard are damageable and not digital technology.

  

But, now a days physical qwerty keyboard become essential which send text signals on computers that are required to do large percentage of tasks without them you can't do much including that alot of services created and managed on computer with assistance from physical qwerty keyboard which is why most people either they like or not use it to full fill thier requirements efficiently.

  

In case of mobile phones that came to replace telephones also have number and text keypad mobile phones in build into device thus you won't have to connect physical qwerty keyboard using any type of cable that's better for sure but still at the end it is physical qwerty keyboard at small size thus they almost have same pros and cons isn't disappointing?

  

Fortunately, Apple inc. a well known popular PC maker developed revolutionary multi-touch technology smartphone named iPhone and then released by it's founder Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007 which came to replace keypad mobile phones and it's the world's first ever smartphone to show up digital qwerty keyboard that amazed everyone.

  

Apple inc. when decided to make iPhone like any other company they done alot of research but as iPhone is something new that was not in existence before which is why they faced many difficulties and challenges for instance Apple inc. mainly Steve Jobs want multi-touch technology on iPhone but Integrating physical qwerty keyboard will disrupt it for sure.

  

The developers team of iPhone 1 and Apple inc. was asked to come up with an solution to get an qwerty keyboard working on iPhone without negetively effecting it's multi-touch technology in that process number of developers showed different ways which didn't satisfied Steve Jobs at the time a developer simply build and showed digital qwerty keyboard that has potential to replace physical ones.

  

Digital qwerty keyboard is quite revolutionary on iPhones closed source operating system iOS that was not just liked and amazed Steve Jobs and Apple inc. team but also people who use iPhone which will speed up typing at the same time you only require one hand that's why most people use digital qwerty keyboard over physical ones on smartphones.

  

Thankfully, In just few years we got multi-touch display technology computers but still almost all PC users prefer and use physical qwerty keyboards as most of them don't come up with multi-touch display technology even if they do still as computers are usually quite big it is hard to manage which is why PC makers build less size PCs and tablets.

  

Google's Android is most popular free and open source operating system unvieled in year 2007 and released world's first time on HTC Dream in year 2008 at first Android powered smartphones used to physical qwerty keyboards but eventually inspired by iPhone begin using digital qwerty keyboards build by developers and companies around the world.

  

G-Board is top digital qwerty keyboard choice of alot of people which gone through alot of upgrades and updates with optimizations and enhancements that also allows you to change themes simply in settings of keyword but over there you can't create and edit G-Board themes except applying pre-available themes.  

  

Thankfully, A developer named RKBD and DerTyp7214 created Rboard manager that allows you to create and patch G-Board themes but in order to do that you have to unlock device bootloader and flash custom recovery like TWRP and install Magisk rooting software by following instructions from trusted portals like XDA which voids device warranty.

  

If you are newbie and do anything wrong in process of rooting Android then your device may hard or soft brick your smartphone which sometimes not repairable that's why it's better for non technical persons to stay away from this risky stuff but it's not possible to get R-Board manager without Magisk as of now.
