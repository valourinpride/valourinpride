If you're from year 1970s or later on then you may probably know that's when many companies started making home video game and begin selling globally which will allow you to play video games by connecting to television anytime and anywhere prior that we are only able to install video games on machines in casinos and retail stores etc due to that alot of people started buying home video game consoles.

  

There are numerous popular home video game console makers out of them Sega Inc. is one which released many home video gaming consoles since year 1983 with it's final release on 2001 after that they stopped manufacturing and selling home video game consoles but focused it's bussines on developing video games for popular home video game consoles since then it is profitable.

  

If you want to play old Sega home video game console then you have to buy used ones from online digital stores where you may only find some but they are expensive and it's not worthy to purchase old home 

video game console now as we have PC aka personal computer and smartphones which can run almost all old home video games through emulator softwares.

  

However, personal computers and smartphones can't directly install any home console video games due to incompatibility of hardware and software but can be run though emulator as it will come in supported format but inside it has implemented environment that you will allow you to run video games for example : operating system or virtual box.

  

Unofficial emulators are developed by third party developers who don't get any support from home video game console makers due to that they have to make and go through alot of coding files in order to make compatible unofficial emulator that support allmost all smartphones which is hard and takes time that's why they stay in early access phase for long time.

  

Fortunately, majority of third party developers who make un-official emulator release it's source code on platforms like  ike GitHub and GitLab etc so that anyone interested around the world on web can become contributer then merge thier  commits to update and upgrade un-official emulators due to that it will get faster optimizations with improvements and advancements to get stable releases.

  

Thankfully, all Sega home video game consoles have un-official emulators as they're atleast two decades old third party developers were able to get stable ones in less time with the help of free and open source projects so that you can play and enjoy Sega video games on personal computer or smartphone smoothly at your convenience comfortably.

  

Recently, we found an smartphone unofficial emulator named Yaba Sanshiro 2 for Sega Saturn home video game console that was released back in year 1994 which was actually commercially failed product but alot of people still like to play it out of curiosity or to bring back old memories for nostalgia reasons, so do you like it? are you interested in Yaba Sanshiro? If yes let's explore more.
