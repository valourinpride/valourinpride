I doubt reliance add flagship features in jio Phone Next but according to pre available images of jio Phone Next they seems like an optimised version of Android especially made for india it's like Android Go version but can't say it is Android Go because jio can't disappoint thier customers users.

  

But, user interface of Jio Phone Next looks like pure Android OS yet can't say exactly how different could be the OS until the launch but UI looks simple like that can give clean good experience to users that you may like to use for sure. Awesome!  

  

**• Reliance Jio 5G Services Soon In India •**
