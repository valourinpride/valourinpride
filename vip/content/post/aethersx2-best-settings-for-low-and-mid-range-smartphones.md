People around the world because of  indoor lifestyle in this modern digital technology era of Millennials and Gen-Z not showing much interest in outdoor games instead they playing high graphics and advanced digital games available on smartphones and home gaming consoles like Nintendo, Sony PlayStation which has potential to give outdoor game experience from indoor spaces itself.

  

Home gaming consoles are expensive especially Sony PlayStation series thus most people don't buy them as there are cheaper alternatives like smartphones to play games that are no match for new and latest home gaming consoles like Sony PS 5 which has super high graphic games but still smartphones has it's own fanbase.

  

Eventhough, PC also known as desktop in modern terms has capable hardware and software to play super high graphic video games yet when smartphones entered into mobile market most people and pc users at large switched to smartphones as they are not only small and compatible in size but also user friendly to carry and move anywhere.

  

Now smartphones become compulsary device for each and every individual in every household as they can do almost all works of PC in its own way and thankfully we have modern smartphones with PC range hardware and software which are capable enough to run some high graphic PC and home console video games but support is very limited and it may take another decade for smartphones to fully run all PC and desktop games.

  

However, The demand to run PC and home consoles video games on smartphones always existed on internet from people around the world but it is not possible in the early days of smartphones but some developers eventually started creating projects and working on them to provide best possible method to run PC softwares and home consoles video games.

  

When smartphones entered in mobile market they used to have low end hardware and software that is very different from PC or home gaming consoles thus it's seems impossible task to run PC and home console video games on smartphones but on Nov 10, 2013 a developer named Henrik Rydgard created a emulator named PPSSPP by using that you can play Sony PlayStation portable aka PSP games on Android powered smartphones.

  

PPSSPP emulator not just mesmerized everyone but also inspired developers over the years to make number of emulators to play almost all home console video games on smartphones for example : DuckStation Emulator, Citra 3DS, WonderSwan, Coleco Emulator, Lemuroid and AetherSX2 etc.

  

Most emulators available for smartphones are unofficial created by third party developers as home gaming console makers usually don't develop official emulators as it will drop sells of thier existing products beside that they don't even provide any support for unofficial emulators due to that third party developers has to go through alot of things to make smartphones hardware and software compatible emulator which is hard and takes so much time even being open source projects on GitHub or GitLab.

  

Anyhow, playing home console video games on mobile emulators is illegal as pirates extract video games also known as roms from original home gaming consoles then upload those files on Internet without permission from gaming console makers which you have to first download then load on your Emulator that is not right but still people like to play games on unofficial emulators over home gaming consoles.

  

Especially, Sony PlayStation video game mobile emulators are very popular as of now we have PPSSPP for PSP, DuckStation for PS2 and AetherSX2 for PS3 but as we said earlier even modern smartphones  don't have capable hardware and software to run home console video games in full scale thus you may face glitches and lags while playing video games for sure.  

  

Fortunately, majority of video game emulators available for smartphones has advanced settings which you can change and adjust according to your smartphone hardware and software capabilities to play video games at max possible graphics and yeah you have to reduce graphics and do few hacks to play at good fps rate on low and mid range smartphones.
