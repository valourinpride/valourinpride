OTT aka over the top online streaming platforms are on rise from past few years on world wide web of internet as everyday many companies developing and releasing numerous commercial OTT platforms to supply demand of people which are now widely used by large percentage of people around the world, isn't that awesome?

  

Most people already know about OTTs but incase you don't know for you in simple OTTs are basically digital platforms which usually provide digital video contents like movies, tv shows, cinemas and anime or cartoons etc but the thing except some almost all popular OTT platforms require you to pay for the paid subscription plans due to that some people who don't have money unable to afford them anytime.

  

Even though, many OTT platforms around the world mainly in india offering amazing digital video content with acceptable price for subscriptions but not every OTT there are some OTT platforms which are quite expensive to many people so they instead of purchasing them go for alternative OTT platforms according to their price range or usually find some other ways to get video content via world wide web on the go.

  

In sense, there are some OTT platforms which subscription price is out of budget line to certain percentage of people which is causing some less business to OTTs so to cover it and reach more people almost all OTTs offer various big discount offers on their subscription plans time to time mainly in special events like in festivals, anniversary sales etc so that people who were unable to buy OTT subscriptions due to tight budget can use this opportunity.

  

Generally, people in large numbers buy OTT platforms subscriptions when there are big discounts on them officially but the thing is certain percentage of people don't buy OTT subscription plans even if there is big discounts as they don't want to spend extra money on anything but OTTs usually like to make business as much as possible so to convert them as customers number of OTTs sometimes provide subscription plans for some limited period of time.

  

The reason why some OTT platforms provide subscriptions plans for free is mainly because to gain users and eventually make them as their customers by luring them to pay for subscription plans in future but there is problem here not every user become customer as they simply use the OTT freebies after that they leave platform which is something most OTT platforms don't like so they use some other methods to lure users again.

  

In order to lure customers now a days many OTT platforms by partnering with some telecom and wifi fiber networks providing their services in package of Internet subscription plans at best rates possible due to that customers see them as freebies and they have no choice other then to use them which is quite beneficial for OTTs but actually they are not freebies customers pay for OTT services indirectly via internet subscription plans, isn't it?

  

However, many people already aware that they are paying for OTT services in name of internet subscription plans so to escape from additional payment for OTT services they use that telecom or wifi fiber plans which don't include OTT services but most of them want OTT services directly at big discounts which is why they look for some ways to pay less price for OTT services.

  

Fortunately, OTT platforms atleast popular ones are already aware that some people don't want to pay for OTT services in name of Internet subscription plans so to convert them as customers many OTT platforms smartly partnering with offline and online stores, movie theatres etc so whenever a person buy products or services from those companies they'll be auto rewarded with free OTT services that may eventually turn them as customers.

  

Meanwhile, some companies which run OTT platforms use different approach to make people as customers like providing OTT subscription plans for free via online websites or products but through jackpot so user have to follow some pre-set steps like sending text sms or call to particular number even play games to reach certain points or levels etc after that out of many some are drawn as winners then they'll be given OTT services as rewards for free.

  

The above stated methods are basically some common marketing strategies and plans used by OTT platforms which are also very much followed by many online music streaming, digital newspapers and softwares, online health consultancy etc companies to increase users and rapidly sell subscription plans to grow customers and make profitable business globally.

  

But, in the end majority of people don't like and prefer to indirectly buy OTT or any other digital product services instead in most cases they want to directly buy them at big discounts then the actual prices but the problem here almost all OTT and other digital services platforms only provide big discounts at certain times not everyday so people have wait till that day patiently.

  

Even if there is any OTT or any digital platforms which continously provide big discounts on subscription plans then very likely the discounted rate is actual price of services but if it's really big discount then what about others as currently people are using number of OTT and digital services platforms to watch digital content and get access to other digital stuff everyday.

  

What if we can get almost all popular and well known OTT and other digital services platforms at big discounts which is not possible from official sources but there are some platforms atleast in india which at present providing many OTT and other digital services platforms at big discounts so that you'll never have to pay full price of services and save money effectively.

  

Usually, it is not enough if you just able to get required OTT and other digital service platforms subscription plans at quite big discounts isn't it? in order to track and manage them well you need right digital platform else they'll be mess for sure after that you may definitely find it bit hard and difficult to use them, don't you think?

  

Recently, we got to know about an feature rich amazing platform named Fleek that offers subscription plans of many top fashion, entertainment, food, dating platforms like Amazon Prime, Zee5, Sony LIV, Hotstar, Hungama, Gaana, JioSaavn, Textbook, Microsoft, McAffe, Medbuddy etc which all you can track and manage with free trials and auto renewals in one roof, so do you like it? are you interested?
