Now, we are in modern era of digital technology with advanced electronic devices build up of hardware mechanical parts integrated with digital technologies which are developed using numerous programming languages by using them you can do almost all real life physical works electronically and digitally if you program and configure them correctly.

  

Internet is digital technology founded by ARPANET on 29, October 1969 is digital technology which is an standard protocol to move data between computers at first it is used to identify computer as it assigns and provides unique IP - internet protocol address to each computer that you can use for various purposes but back then in early development stage Internet is private and can only send digital messages.

  

Fortunately, in year 1991 inventor Tim Berners Lee released www aka world wide web an browser basically software to open public contents of Internet on compatible electronic devices like computers due to that alot of people started creating many different types of digital platforms on thier computer hardware and publicly sharing them on internet via servers to access them on www - world wide web.

  

Thankfully, people and companies for personal or commercial reasons created and released revolutionary and amazing digital technologies since web 1.0 era but back then in order to deploy any type of digital platforms like websites or blogs etc you must have computer with big storage as per the size of your digital platforms and sufficient memory known as RAM to handle vistors on your digital platforms.

  

Unfortunately, majority of people back in Web 1.0 era unable to create and connect to digital platforms as it's bit technical and require sufficient storage and memory on computers which most people don't have at that time but eventually as world wide web keep on advancing many companies according to demand and requirements started making big storage and memory computers for extensive usages.

  

Even though, we have powerful and advanced computers by Web 2.0 started in 20th century yet they are expensive so not everyone can buy them even if you can still in case your digital platforms require huge storage and consume RAM so much due of millions of visitors load then you have to buy alot of computers with upgrade in both hardware and software that's hard to manage and costly thus only companies can have them unless you're billionaire.

  

Generally, individuals or teams can't afford super computers which is why numerous entrepreneurs and companies since web 1.0 created and released cloud storage and server digital platforms on www aka  world wide web of internet which in back end use hardware storage and money but you can't see them instead you'll get them in digital form on websites accessible on browsers available in supported electronic devices like computers and smartphones.

  

The entry of cloud storage and server digital platforms simplified the process of public hosting digital platforms on internet as they are in digital form and provide alot of useful options and features with flexible plans thus anyone even newbie can make and publish his digital platforms publicly on internet easily and comfortably.

  

However, most digital cloud storage and server platforms aren't free even if they do they mostly put advertisements or provide services for limited time isn't? for instance Heroku is popular and well known popular cloud server digital platform used by alot of people especially developers as it give free cloud server to deploy apps or Github repositores manually or automatically but it's cloud sever usage limited to 550 dyno hours, isn't disappointing?

  

Many people and developers used to depend on Heroku free service even though it has limitations smartly but on Heroku announced that they will stop all it's free plans to make them as paid only services due to that existing users who don't want to pay for cloud servers are searching for alternative to Heroku.

  

Recently, we found an simple and fast digital serverless platform named Kobey which has alot of features that provides 5$ credit each month to get 512mb ram that you can use to manually or automatically deploy all your docker images apps and GitHub repositories for free.

  

Note : currently, Kobey is providing free plan to let you deploy apps and GitHub repository projects but there is chance that Kobey may stop it's free services anytime in future for any reasons after getting enough users like Heroku so do you use still like it? are you interested? if yes let's explore more.
