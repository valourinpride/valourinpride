Messenger, a software available for computers and smartphones that will provide graphical user interface aka GUI with many features to let you chat with your friends or anyone in the world using your phone number or username there are numerous types of messengers out there on Internet and each messenger can have it's own mechanism and technology.

  

Usually, basic SMS messengers will let you send messages using phone numbers and save those messages in phone storage or sim card and then we have advanced and modern social messengers like whatsapp, signal and telegram etc which will ask you phone number or email for verification and then they may provide username by using it you can send messages to people who use the same social messenger.

  

Almost all modern social messengers protect your messages using some kind of end to end encryption technology like AES 256 etc thus no one can easily access them but as social messengers use centralized cloud servers to store your messeges there is high risk of data theft as centralised cloud servers are main target to black hat hackers.

  

Hackers can exploit cloud server of your messenger to gain access to messages of people then hacker can extract and publish data on internet or Darkweb for fun or money that can cause privacy and security concerns even developer of your social messenger can access cloud server to see users messagers they they can sell to marketing companies which is why people who want extreme privacy don't use cloud based social messengers.

  

However, there are some social messengers like Telegram known for best privacy and security that has powerful cloud server and thier own encryption protocol named MTProto which seems to encrypt your messages better then other social messaging platforms who don't even share keys to law enforcement agencies but still Telegram is based on centralized cloud server thus privacy and security is not guaranteed especially in this digital technology world.

  

In 21st century, we have numbers of powerful equipment and tools that are capable to exploit any centralized cloud server thus if you super care about privacy and security then it's better to avoid social messengers which use centralized servers instead you can check out decentralized messengers that will host your messages on numerous servers around the globe provided by individuals like you thus it's near to im-possible for anyone to hack and access your messages.

  

Web3 is future upgrade of internet where people use decentralized servers to host websites for top privacy and security even though it's not completely available yet but over the years we got numerous platforms based on Web3 concept like decentralized crypto currencies, DeFi, VPNs, blockchain domains, cloud storage, comment system etc and now decentralized messengers are also coming up from futuristic developers around the world to increase the scale of Web3 decentralized products.

  

Recently, we found a P2P aka peer to peer decentralized crypto messenger named Speek! that uses Tor aka the onion routing software a open source project that is decentralized by design but Tor use relays hosted by individuals which work like servers to store and route data as this relays change frequently it is very hard to interrupt them and see data inside it as Tor provide best secure and privacy most hackers use it to cover thier identity which is also used to access Darkweb.

  

Tor provide anonymity on Internet so no one can trace and access your data including law enforcement agencies even though they can raid the exit relay to trace your data yet it's very unlikely to happen unless you're most wanted criminal so for best security and privacy Speek! is routing all your messages through Tor network.

  

Speek! is completely free and open source peer to peer decentralized messenger that don't require any phone number or email address instead you will be given unique address which is required to connect with people even there is no file sharing size limit on Speek! thus it's definitely better then Telegram and Threema, so do we got your attention? are you interested in Speek! if yes let's explore more.
