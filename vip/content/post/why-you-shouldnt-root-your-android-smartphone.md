Rooting Android does give you access to system level files which you can modify or edit to customize and get new features on your Android smartphone, but getting root level access aka superuser on Android not only compromise security and privacy but also give easy access to hackers to inject malwares, virus etc at root level thus they can surveillance or snatch personal data without your permission.

There are many reasons why people root thier Android smartphones, but the main one is because of smartphone companies as they stop providing latest software and security updates after 1 or 2 years on old smartphones, thus users who don't want to buy new smartphones root Android to get latest features.

However, it's ok to root your spare old Android smartphone where you don't store your personal data but it's better to avoid rooting your new smartphone where you keep your personal data as once you root your new smartphone it will unlock root level access, so if you visit or install any malicious payload website or app due to root level access on your smartphone it will be easy for hackers to exploit and hijack your smartphone.

Usually, most banking and payment apps won't work on rooted Android devices as they know rooted Android smartphones doesn't have much security thus hackers can take your device under thier control to illegally transfer your funds anonymously which will lead to financial losses,Â

If you're a person who use banking apps on Android then it's always better to stay away from rooting to keep your funds safe

but this doesn't mean hackers can't hijack non-rooted smartphones as they are many methods to hack non-rooted smartphones as well but non-rooted Android devices are not easy to hack due to device encryption and restriction to root level files, unless they use law enforcements spyware.

Anyhow, one shouldn't root Android smartphone without knowledge as if you incorrectly edit or modify any root level file then it will soft or hard brick your Android smartphone which is irreparable including that rooting is not easy as first you have to unlock bootloader of your device in order to root using guides specifically created for your device from portals like [XDA](http://xda.com).

Rooting also voids warranty as most smartphone companies clearly mention this on thier manual booklets, once you root Android smartphone you can't claim warranty for both hardware and software damages occurred on your smartphone under 1 or 2 years warranty period.

Majority of users who root Android don't increase or customize CPU cores but alot of geeks and low proccessor device users increase CPU and GPU cores and change it's giga hertz to increase performance of device, but the problem with CPU and GPU increase is they put alot of strain on CPU cores so eventually your Android device become slow even not usable over time.
