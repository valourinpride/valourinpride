Nokia, is it your first keypad mobile phone? majority of people around the world had their first keypad mobile phone from Nokia as back then like few decades they're very dominant strong hold keypad mobile phone maker globally for long time but due to poor business decisions back in time they didn't entered into smartphones industry when most of it's competitors like Samsung and many companies around the world started making smartphones.

  

Smartphones are handheld electronic device evolution of mobile phones and PDAs came with modern technologies to replace keypad mobile phones which has powerful hardware and advanced software to do almost all tasks of PCs aka personal  computers in it's own way by using it you can not just install digital softwares but also make telecom network based calls and messages etc, isn't that amazing?

  

Since, the entry of first smartphone as it's revolutionary and pretty useful people in large numbers started buying and shifting to them from. keypad mobile phones to stay up to date that drasically increased demand for smartphones so numerous companies started making plans to make them except Nokia but the main challenge they have to is develop operating system basically software for smartphones which is hard and take long time as well.

  

Most companies like Samsung, Sony, LG have existing infrastructure to make top notch quality hardware for smartphones but what they lack is advanced proper software that compete with Apple Inc's iPhone closed source operating system iOS but eventually in just 1 year Google launched amazing open source operating system named Android that anyone can use it so number of people and companies started using it on smartphones.

  

Meanwhile, Nokia being pioneer and #1 top keypad mobile phone maker after few years when it's competitors like Samsung already got hold of smartphones market eventually started making smartphones as per trend to make business and supply the demand from customers but once again Nokia did another blunder mistake by not using Android on it's smartphones instead they Integrated custom SymbianOS.

  

SymbianOS is well known and popular open source operating system that was actually made for PDAs but Nokia is one of the main backers of SymbianOS which they used on most keypad mobile phones after that they Integrated on smartphones but it's not upto mark to right on compete with Android including that most people back then got used to Android so didn't given much attention and recognition to SymbianOS, are you one of them?

  

Anyhow, In the end SymbianOS failed that negetively effected Nokia who already got huge financial losses due to failure of it's SymbianOS smartphones yet somehow able to continue thanks to it's brand value and trusted customers worldwide at that time Nokia for whatever reasons didn't use Android software instead partnered with PC software maker Microsoft to develop and release Windows Lumia series.

  

Lumia series smartphones got applause for it's hardware and software quality and appreciated the partnership of Nokia and Microsoft but eventually for almost same reasons Windows software on the Nokia Lumia smartphones failed mainly due to lack of apps and user friendly developer support including that most people liked and preffered Android smartphones over Windows that hit hard on Nokia this time it negetively effected them immensely.

  

In sense, Nokia failed in smartphone market as they decided to not use Android even if they acknowledged it's potential or not doesn't matter at the people see the result, anyway Nokia continued it's keypad mobile phone business which is running pretty well now but smartphone sector is shelved for more then decade now they may not start it again anytime soon.

  

However, the employees of Nokia by talking trademark rights of Nokia started making Nokia brand smartphones under HMD Global a chinese company which is now making stock Android based Nokia smartphones with long term updates and upgrades like iOS including that they are making innovative technologies to add on their Nokia smartphones like OZO.

  

OZO is spatial digital audio recording technology from Nokia specifically designed and developed for it's ozo virtua reality camera and some smartphones as well camera which uses all mics basically 3 to record from all sides to give surround sound but this technology is not available on official audio recording app of Nokia.

  

There is huge demand from customers to get spatial recording technology on app instead in camera but for whatever reasons Nokia didn't Integrated it at that time XDA senior developer named black.rider555 ported few codes of OZO into official audio recording app of Nokia and added spatial recording technology isn't that super cool and awesome?

  

Now there is one mod of Nokia recorder app that support OZO spatial audio  format including that black.rider555 changed theme and also forced surround sound which use 3 mics at once but as this technology is made for camera it's better to record sounds in landscape mode on smartphones just like recording video even if you don't do anyone on this you will still get high quality for sure.

  

Usually, sound that recorded and processed using digital technologies like software developed using programming languages on electronic devices is known as audio which mostly use 1 microphone as each microphone used for different purposes like calling but this OZO spatial technology use more mics then usual thus you'll get better quality then regular ones.

  

In our test of spatial recording on mod nokia sound recorder of black.rider555 we clearly seen quite big noticeable difference of audio quality, we tested system default sound recorder app at the end in comparison mod Nokia sound recorder is not just way better but also provided clear high quality audio which you can definitely use on the go.

  

Note : Black.rider555 ported this sound recorder for Nokia and other smartphones which support spatial recording technology so keep that mind though you may still able to install and open to use on any Android smartphones but spatial audio may not work if it does then all is well, so do you like it? are you interested? If yes then let's explore more.
