Above, you can see the key features of Tecno Pova 1 and 2 as we got few little upgrades interms of different designs, bigger battery, high pixel camera, minor upgraded processor and high refresh rate, NFC in Tecno Pova 2 which is surely beneficial but if you own Tecno Pova first version we think there is no need to upgrade because there are minor upgrades only so kindly try to upgrade from  tecno Pova to Tecno Pova 2 only if it is absolutely necessary.

  

Both Tecno Pova and Tecno Pova 2 are value for money products priced at similar range and yeah if you don't own any Tecno Pova and looking to buy a new smartphone then you can opt for Tecno Pova 2 instead Tecno Pova 2 it is recommended because you are getting better features, latest up to date technology with Tecno Pova 2.

  

Finally, Tecno Pova 2 is overall better then Tecno Pova but again it is worth stating there is no need to upgrade unnecessarily to Tecno Pova 2 if you own Tecno Pova 1 as we ruled out with comparsion here, however do mention your opinions in comment section below and don't forget to say us why you like tecno mobiles, see ya :)
