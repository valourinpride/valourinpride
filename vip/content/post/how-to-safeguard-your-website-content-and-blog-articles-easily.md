Internet is standard protocol created by ARPANET to move digital data between electronic computers created in mid 19th century prior that we used to depend on various hardware based mechanical parts computers which don't use electricity but the founder of computer Charles Babbage introduced and released many concepts of computers in early 18th century specifying it's features that're later implemented on almost all electronic computers.

  

Especially, since mid 19th century alot of new and renowned inventors themselves or with entrepreneurs and companies started entensive developments on electronic computers using the existing concepts of Charles Babbage or new ones created themselves or anyone with necessary changes and modifications based on availability of technologies at that time to upgrade electronic computers for personal and commercial reasons accordingly due to that rapid progress of  advancements begin.

Fortunately, we got numerous revolutionary new upgrades and technologies Integrated on electronic computers out of them IP aka internet is one which assigns and provide unique IP

address to each computer for several usage purposes mainly for identification at first in beginnings it was used to just send digital messages between two electronic computere but in order to do that you need to get manual access from electronic computer else it will stay private.

  

Thankfully, the continous developements on electronic computers leaded to super computers but they are big and expensive due to that not everyone can afford unless you're an millionaire with free large space which is why common people back then unable to get electronic computers in order to change this scenario many inventors and companies build small and home compatible personal computers.

John Blankenbaker of Kenbak Corporation released world's first PC aka personal computers in year 1971 which was considered as first personal computer to truly use stored program concept of Charles Babbage to run software prior that In year 1948 Machester baby computer is first electronic computer to execute stored program in it's processor but it don't have any display and softwares in visible mode.

However, PCs came with display monitors with different compatible softwares like CLI aka command line interface developed using various programming languages where you have to send keyboard commands to access and use PCs that's hard isn't unless your programmer which is why inventors and companies created GUI aka graphical user interface softwares for personal computers to simplify usage.

Alto Parc Xerox is world's first personal computer integrated with GUI based operating system basically software released in year 1973 by that time Internet gone through alot of improvements to do more then before but still it has same limitations and restrictions due to that  people were unable to utilise Internet full potential and capabilities extensively yet the developement of PCs hardware and digital software continued that leaded to even better and flexible PCs.

  

 [![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-yoqHd7pb-QU/YyG57Ip5uII/AAAAAAAANuQ/OC49T7Fy9eYCQCho4b-k4T-uAZL0UBjYgCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/1663154662486104-4.png)](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-yoqHd7pb-QU/YyG57Ip5uII/AAAAAAAANuQ/OC49T7Fy9eYCQCho4b-k4T-uAZL0UBjYgCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/1663154662486104-4.png) 

  

  

In year 1991, PCs got decent hardware that was capable to run basic digital softwares at that time inventor Tim Berners Lee created and released WWW aka world wide web browser software which can crawl and show public contents of internet due to that it recieved huge recognition globally and with in less time alot of people around the world started created different types of digital platforms known in form of websites and blogs that can do almost all real life physical works of people digitally or electronically just like electronic computers and PCs softwares.

  

Anyhow, World Wide Web is first browser after that developers and companies created better browser softwares and digital platforms for personal or commercial reasons but they used to create digital platforms on thier PC hardware and then create server that utilises RAM also known memory to handle vistors load of digital platforms that seems fine and understandable isn't? 

  

But, the problem here is back in 1990s PCs hardware is basic at that time they are powerful and advanced but only capable to handle load of couple hundreds of visitors in order to support more creators of digital platforms have to upgrade thier hardware and software that's quite expensive due to that alot of creators unable to create and manage big data digital platforms for large percentage of vistors which is why alot of visitors used to face downtimes on digital platforms.

  

Majority of electronic and tech industry companies back in 1990s created huge cloud hosting and servers integrated with content management systems which in back end use big and powerful hardware storage and ram infrastructure that you can't see instead you will get them in digital form with alot of options and features to host your digital platforms but only few of them are unlimited remaining all are mostly paid plans ones.

Blogger from search engine giant Google and WordPress from Automatic inc. are well known popular content management platforms available since long time which provide unlimited powerful cloud storage and server to store any size database when you comply with thier terms of service and policies but only drawback is you only get free domain for custom domain you to buy from Google domains or Integrate from other custom domain providers like GoDaddy, Bigrock etc.

  

Meanwhile, there are cloud hosting platforms that provide storage and server to host websites on multiple content management platforms including wordpress except blogger but most of them are paid you have to pay on monthly or annual basis even if you found one free  they may very likely has certain limitations and restrictions so most people prefer and like to use Blogger and WordPress.

  

Anyway, you use any digital cloud hosting or content management system they usually provide an option to manually or automatically backup your small or big digital platforms like websites content and blog articles into thier own or third party cloud storage and electronic device hardware storage for paid or free right? 

  

Generally, majority of creators who publish text, video or file based content on thier digital platforms either website or blog on internet of world wide web usually want to  backup them for later usages and protect from uncertain issues that can occur in future like they may forgot password of cloud hosting platforms or it goes down due to whatever reasons or hackers got access to cloud platform and changed password due to that unable to access domain and content management system etc in that cases backup is savior.

  

Usually, since the era of web 1.0 almost all creators of websites and blogs backup thier websites and blogs on hardware storage of PCs and mainly on smartphone which came in replacement of keypad mobile phones with operating systems that can almost all works of PC in it's own way so it was now widely used by people more then PCs to create digital platforms by people around the world as right now smarphones are less expensive and much more user friendly then PCs.

  

In 21st century, we have modern computers and smartphones with powerful hardware and software included with big storage and memory capacity hardware or static drive disks like giga or terra byte but still it's not unlimited so incase you have database that exceeds storage capacity then you have to go for reliable and trustworthy digital cloud hosting platforms who can provide more sixe cloud storage which is pretty much accessible anywhere and anytime on supported browser with set up login thus it's better and companies but it can be exploited by black hat hackers.

Now a days, almost all modern cloud storage and server digital platforms in current web 2.0 era started early 20th century use and depend on centralised servers to host users websites and blogs which are managed by one or multiple companies and encrypted with advanced security technologies developed over the time specifically build and designed to manage this tasks safely but still it's centralized cloud server black hat hackers who are criminals primarly target and use various technologies and exploit them to illegally gain access to cloud storage or server to take it down and delete etc.

  

In sense, centralized cloud storage and server platforms are not totally safe which is why we are slowly upgrading to Web 3.0 where websites and blogs are divided into numerous parts then encrypted and hosted on many decentralized servers known as nodes globally provided by company or individuals so they are much safer to store your website and blog data but still if the Web 3.0 cloud storage and server provider itself goes down then there is nothing much you can do about it.

  

**[\+ Storj - best decentralized cloud storage for security and privacy.](https://www.techtracker.in/2022/04/storj-best-decentralized-cloud-storage.html)**

  

It is recommended to manually or automatically backup your website or blog etc weekly or monthly into your device storage and reliable centralized or de-centralized digital cloud storage platforms including that don't forget to save them on archive digital platforms that most people don't know and aware off.

  

We have several archive platforms out of them few are free like web.archive.org and archive.ph are non profit organizations depend on donations which are available since long time like more then decade from the early days of internet web archive.org is constantly crawling internet to save every possible webpages and snapshots of websites and blog articles due to that it now has more 734+ billion webpages and snapshots.

  

Web archive.org and archive.ph current domain may available with other domain extensions as well which automatically save majority of websites webpages and snapshots but in case yours not saved then it provides option where you not just save digital platforms like webpages but also digital files like audio and video etc atleast on web.archive.org isn't amazing? 

  

Eventhough, digital archive platforms web.archive.org and archive.ph may be using centralized and decentralized cloud storage and servers has resources and funds if supported to save your digital webpages or files for long time yet still there is no guarantee as anytime they can go down for whatever reasons so don't overly depend on them but considering several scenarios popular archive platforms has high probability to stay alive on world wide web of internet over other cloud storage and server platforms as they are available since long time.

  

Note : before using any archive digital platforms make sure to read thier of service and policies as like any digital cloud storage and server platform they have right to remove any material mainly copyrigh ones so only share which you own and in public ones not provide if you do then you're in safe zone they will not remove your submitted webpages, files etcso do you like it? are you interested?? If yes let's explore more.
