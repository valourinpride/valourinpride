3D aka 3 dimension object has length, height, and depth thus it visual look and feel is much detailed and better then in 1D and 2D dimension as in 1D and 2D objects there will be no dept due to that they look and feel flat though they have physical presence and has own importance with number of pros and cons but usually most people like and prefer to see and create 3D objects as they are 3D objects themselves including that 3D objects are way visually more appealing and attractive to eyes then the 1D and 2D objects isn't it?

  

However, all 1D, 2D and 3D objects given equal importance as each have their own prospects and drawbacks which is why some people based on their taste and requirements like and want to see or use 1D, 2D, 3D objects accordingly but the problem here with 1D is it's line segement due to that it doesn't have any other characteristics so majority of people use 2D or 3D as they have characteristics to create arts, cartoons, movies, animes etc which are enjoyed by people globally.

  

But, 1D is essential and required by using that only it is possible to form 2D or 3D objects using physical or digital materials back then like few decades back majority of people mainly used ink colors to sketch 2D or 3D objects on paper but eventually when electronic computers Integrated with digital softwares entered in this world at that time many people started using that fantastic technologies to create 2D or 3D objects digitally isn't that super cool?

  

Fortunately, digital technologies known as operating system basically softwares are developed using numerous programming languages gone through many updates and upgrades over the years mainly since digital revolution due to that now we have modern powerful and advanced electronic computers and digital technologies which are now widely used by a lot of people to make 2D and 3D objects extensively.

  

Thankfully, there are number of developers who specifically designed and developed amazing digital softwares for electronic computers and for it's evolution home compatible PCs aka personal computers which are capable enough to let you create high quality and defination aka HD heavy resources 2D and 3D objects conveniently and comfortably but large percentage of people for whatever reasons still like to create 2D and 3D objects physically using traditional methods immensely.

  

Eventhough, both physical and digital technologies are used to create 2D and 3D objects for various different purposes but they are mostly and mainly drawn and created to make wide variety of moving games and films etc which are bit hard to make using traditional methods as you have to draw each and every 2D or 3D objects movemet manually which is not only hard and difficult but also take long time at that time to simplify this process many people begin using digital softwares to create 2D or 3D objects efficiently.

  

The artificial digital 2D and 3D objects are known as graphics and to create them there are number of amazing softwares like Blender, Maya, Cinema4D and many more but the thing is they are proffesional 

softwares and mostly only available for PCs which are not easy to handle and use so you need skills to develop different types of 2D or 3D graphics of them which can take years to master them so if you're  are newbie then you may can't make rich 2D or 3D graphic objects instantly.

  

What if, we can use digital camera technology that capture 2D photographs of anything to capture 3D objects also known as models it will ease up process right? a decade back digital cameras doesn't have technologies to make 3D objects but from past few years we got number of revolutionary technologies like AI aka artificial intelligence and machine learning due to them digital cameras got capability to capture 3D objects which are now widely used to make 3D graphics and use on digital media ventures with the help of 3D maker softwares like Blender.

  

In sense, the digital cameras individually can't capture 3D objects unless they're integrated with required technologies which are usually available on both PCs and smartphones but makers don't Integrate high megapixel cameras on PCs as it's not handheld instead they're mainly used on smartphones which is why if you want to make high graphic 3D objects then it's always better to use smartphones.

  

Smartphones are definitely capable of capturing 3D objects in 360° view which when processed known as 3D content or models but the thing here is processing 3D content need powerful and advanced modern hardware and software with big storage and memory capacity which are available on smartphones but not to the level of modern PCs due to that mainly low and mid range smartphones may take long time to process 3D models then PCs.

  

Anyhow, if you have high end flagship smartphones then for sure you can scan and create high quality 3D content models but there are different types of 3D content models like foodgrammetry, diorama, CG, figure, collage etc so it is quite important to choose such software on smartphone that can capture most 3D types thus you can right on use them well in all possible platforms that let you stay up to date.

  

We have number of softwares available for smartphones where you can create 3D content modules but they don't come with community so you can't check and use someone else 3D content modules which is bit dissapointing as having community not just let you learn and explore about 3D content modules but also collaborate with fellow nunet of creators to use 3D content modules for your projects on the go.

  

Recently, we got to know about world's first 3D content creation app that with

Photo Scan let you scan and create high quality 3D content modules then view and play directly in augmented reality on your smartphones then you can export the 3D  content modules to use in digital game or in VFX effect in movies, architecture, AR, VR , construction, 3D, printing, NFT etc.

  

Especially, WIDAR allow you to export videos and share them on SNS, or export them in object data formats such as OBJ, FBX, and use them with 3DCG softwares  and game engines such as Unity, Unreal Engine. It is also possible to output in a real form with a 3D printer including that 

you can share with community isn't that cool, so do you like it? are you interested? If yes then let's explore more.

Atlast, this are just highlighted features of WIDAR there may be many hidden features in-build that provides you external benefits to give the ultimate usage experience, anyway if you want one of the best app to scan and create 3D contents then WIDAR is on go worthy choice for sure.

  

Overall, WIDAR comes with light and dark mode by default, it has clean and simple interface that ensures user friendly experience, but in any project there is always space for improvement so let's wait and see will WIDAR get any major UI changes in future to make it even more better, as of now it's fantastic.

  

Moreover, it is definitely worth to mention WIDAR is one of the very few 3D contents creator app available out there on world wide web of internet for smartphones that uses digital cameras, yes indeed if you're searching for such app then WIDAR has potential to become your new favourite.

  

Finally, this is how you can create 3D obect content modules on smartphones using WIDAR, are you an existing user of WIDAR? If yes do say your experience and mention why you like and prefer WIDAR over other 3D content creator apps in our comment section below, see ya :)
