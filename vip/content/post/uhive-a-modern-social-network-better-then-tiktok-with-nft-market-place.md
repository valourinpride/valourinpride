TikTok is well known short video sharing platform developed by chinese company named byte dance for creators around the world to showcase thier content in short 60 seconds video, TikTok is way different from other video sharing platforms because TikTok won't allow lengthy videos which is the main reason TikTok got alot of popularity very fast as people wanted quick fun and entertainment on the go without wasting thier valuable time.

  

TikTok created enormous trend for short videos content that even effected Google to come up with Shorts feature in Official Youtube app and numerous companies inspired by TikTok developed many short video sharing apps but later on after few successful years TikTok got into trouble as few countries banned TikTok due to data breach & privacy concerns including India due to that people were not able to access and use TikTok.

  

However, The ban of TikTok some how did good atleast in india, after the ban of TikTok in india, Narendra Modi - The Prime Minister of india launched program named aatma nirbhaar bharat - self reliant india to progress and achieve without relying on foriegn technology in all platforms which also includes digital technology.

  

Aatma nirbhaar bharat with its policies helped, inspired and motivated indian companies and developers to make world class apps, so with the effect of Aatma Nirbhaar Bharat program we also got to see many alternatives to be exact inspired clones of TikTok with Indian flavour like roposo, josh, MXTakaTaka, etc in india which is good fortune.

  

Eventhough, TikTok is definitely a cool and amazing short video sharing platform but it is currently only targeting to provide short video sharing platform so it can't satisfy majority of users because as TikTok lack numerous features which are insisted and required by millions of people like in TikTok you can't post photos and create new spaces for different topics or contents, no groups chat, TikTok is not decentralised platfrom, No direct chats, No NFT in TikTok so it can't impress or useful to crypto lovers and many more.

  

So, In this scenario, we have a workaround we found a social network app named UHIVE that is very similar to Facebook but also provide you feel & similarity of TikTok but when compared with TikTok in UHIVE you'll get alot of unique features that you won't find and experience in other social media & short video sharing platforms.

  

UHIVE will be useful to content creator, influencer, or normal social media user which provides enjoyable immersive 3d social media experience with it's oasis space like 3d interactive map where you can create numerous free and paid spaces for your content and also explore, find rich content spaces of your favourite interests, including that UHIVE states it operates a decentralised moderation protocol due to that you'll get true freedom of expression and speech with zero censorship.

  

UHIVE will turn your content and profile into NFT - non fungible token and list it's on market place where you can buy and sell thousand of digital assets including that in UHIVE as we said you can create free spaces and paid spaces but in UHIVE paid spaces it has potential of most valuable NFTs that  are unique and they solely belong to the account holder, They are like virtual real estate, where you can buy additional spaces, or sell your own spaces, but a space’s value can be determined by its location in the Uhive’s universe, levels of engagement, amount of content, and more.

  

UHIVE is currently in early access phase so you may able to find bugs and issues, but certainly UHIVE will be more amazing and better in the upcoming releases, even now UHIVE is near to perfection and we didn't found even single issue according to our personal usage experience, so do we  got your attention on UHIVE? are you very interested in UHIVE? If yes let's know little more it before we explore UHIVE.
