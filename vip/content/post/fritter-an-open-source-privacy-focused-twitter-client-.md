Official Twitter app is closed source and it is filled with thier own ads and certain backend tools that can collect your personal data like IP address, browser type, operating system & cookie information & many more, so if you are serious about privacy and security of your personal private information then official Twitter app may probably not a right choice.

  

So, if you want to use Twitter without login account then it is not possible through the official twitter app or website because the official twitter app & website restricted the usage of its services and features to those who do not have twitter account so privacy & security serious people were not be able to use official twitter app and website until they provide required personal data which is needed according to twitter terms and conditions that you have to accept while creating a twitter account.

  

In this scenario, we have a workaround we found an open source privacy focused and friendly Twitter client named fritter which don't require a twitter account to use the twitter services and it's features so it is definitely useful and a fortune for privacy and security oriented people as they can use twitter without creating account and providing personal information!
