If you're an 3d artist or learning to become an 3d artist then you may probably know  Blender which is an free open source 3d computer graphic software created by developers and 3d artists around the world for 3d artists to make GGI, visual effects, 

3d animations, 3d designs etc alternative to paid 3d computer graphics softwares like Maya, Cinema 4D, 3ds Max etc.

  

Blender is constantly improving and adding new tools to complete with paid 3d graphic softwares at every level, but the problem is in order to render 3d files on paid or free software you must have high end PC or else you have to use cloud rendering platforms which are expensive, while most beginners who are excited to learn or build 3d graphics unable to afford them.
