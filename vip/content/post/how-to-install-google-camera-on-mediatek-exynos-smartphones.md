Camera, is a revolutionary hardware device at first it was used to capture and record real life objects known as photographs in black and white mode then save them on negetive reels but later on thanks to Inventors who developed camera further due to them we got color mode cameras yet they used to rely on negetive reels so in order view photographs we have to manually go through photo processing  that require additional equipments.

  

Fortunately, In year 1975 Steven Saason invented digital camera that can store photographs as digital files known as images and films as videos on SRAM or DRAM since then camera companies around the world started making thier own versions of digital cameras using and adapting to various new technologies to improve and add new features due to that we got advanced digital cameras.

  

Digital cameras over the years gone through rapid advancements due to that in 21st century we have small and modern DSLR digital cameras which can right now capture 8K high resolution images and videos then save them on HDDs aka hard drives or SDDs aka static state drives based on storage capacity after that you can view images and videos on attached display monitor or supported electronic devices with compatible softwares.

There is huge demand for modern digital cameras around the world as they're not just easy to use but also professional so companies for personal or commercial reasons started integrating almost all modern digital cameraa latest hardware and software technologies on many other 

electronic devices like PCs aka personal computers, mobile and smartphones etc.  

  

Even though, at first digital camera resolution on PCs, mobiles and smartphones is very low like 0.3mp and 1mp etc but later on because of continous developements from mobile companies digital cameras of smartphones are now competing with many DSLR cameras in terms of resolution and features etc.

  

However, DSLR digital cameras may capture better image quality than that of smartphones as DSLR digital cameras are specifically developed and designed using powerful technologies to simply capture high resolution images and videos in any scenarios even in low lightning condition environments so they are widely used in movies, events, tourism, photography and other important or expensive projects.

Anyhow, now Sony a popular and well known top digital camera company is continuously implementing almost all of it's technologies on Sony smartphones to improve resolution and make them reach the level of DSLR digital cameras thus on Sony smartphones you'll get best camera quality after that Apple inc. new iPhone smartphones known to capture quality high resolution images and videos par to Sony flagship smartphones.

  

The quality of images captured through digital camera is not just depeneded on hardware but also on software as it will process the image to provide well refined quality image output which is why even if you have high mega pixel digital camera it may sometimes or everytime struggle to compete with less mega pixel camera as here that camera is probably using better quality mega pixels or using an advanced software to process and generate high quality resolution images and videos.

  

In sense, software plays main role on digital cameras to get quality output as software in processing phase remove noise then tune images and videos to its best for quality shot that's why alot of camera and smartphones makers are from long time simultaneously focusing on both digital cameras hardware and it's software to improve quality of images and videos but some companies don't focus on software instead they rely on hardware which may also work but it's always better to focus on both hardware and software on digital cameras for best results.

Meanwhile, Google a popular search engine giant founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in year 1996 buyed an operating system named Android from Andy Rubens in year 2005 for $50 millon after that they partnered with Taiwanese mobile maker HTC and released world's first Android powered smartphone on September 23, 2008 named HTC Dream G1 to compete with Apple inc. iPhones.

  

Thankfully, after HTC Dream Google partnered with many other mobile companies like Samsung, LG, Motorola etc to release more Android OS smartphones and as Google smartly released Android as free and open source project anyone can use it so mobile companies around tbe world in just few years used Android extensively to ship thier own Android powered smartphones globally.

  

Even though, Android smartphones has more then 70% worldwide market share and give edge to edge competition with iPhone on almost all segments but in terms of digital camera quality Android smartphones except Sony are behind iPhone because Apple inc. use costly quality cameras and do alot of software optimizations to scale up image and video quality of new iPhone model smartphones.

Google known to do mavellous magics with software technologies so in order to fix low camera quality issue on  Android powered smartphones released Google Camera on April 16, 2014 that drastically improve images and videos quality using many Google's software algorithms but later for some reasons Google stopping upgrading it's Google camera and made it as closed source OEM app on Google Pixel smartphones.

  

Google Camera is amazing app that depends mainly on software to generate greater quality images and videos even if hardware is mediocre because of that it received millons of users but unfortunately after Google ends support they have no choice other then to use alternative better camera apps like stock or Open Camera.

  

Luckily, A developer named [BSG](http://) in year 2018 using many tricks and methods managed to port Google's Pixel exclusive Google Camera to Snapdragon Qualcomm 800+ processor smartphone after that many third party developers gradually started porting Google Camera to other Qualcomm Snapdragon 800, 600, 700 series smarphones which are officially not supported by Google Camera.

Google camera comes with plenty of cool and amazing features that are unavailable on most camera apps especially potriat and night mode are awesome by using potriat mode you can completely blur background of selfies and then night mode on Google Camera is fabulous you will shot best possible visible image even in low lighting dark scenarios that no other camera app even iPhone at that time can pull such quality images so eventually everyone eagerly want to try out Google Camera.

  

Unfortunately, Google Camera development and ports are very much concentrated and focused on Qualcomm processor as Snapdragon chipsets are developer friendly and Google officially make Google Camera for Qualcomm Snapdragon processors as they use them on Pixel smartphones so majority of Google Camera ports are not compatible with other processors like Mediatek and Samsung Exynos smartphones.

  

Even many old smartphones that comes with low end Qualcomm Snapdragon processors don't support Google Camera due to lack of ports and support from third party developers and mainly hardware incompatibility as in order to run Google Camera your smartphone must support Camera 2 API else it's impossible.

  

Now a days almost all Mediatek and Samsung Exynos processor smarphones has Camera API 2 support so third party developers by working hard managed to port Google Camera to few Mediatek and Samsung Exynos smartphones but still they may have bugs and not stable as from source itself Google Camera is only compatible with Qualcomm Snapdragon processor smarphones.

  

Majority of people who use Mediatek and Exynos processor want to try Google Camera which they can try to test luck it may most likely get force closed but you can try old versions of Google Camera released in year 2014 to 2016 as at the time Google developed Google Camera for all processor smartphones so there is high probability that your smartphone is compatible with old Google Camera.

But, remmember old Google Camera versions are developed for old Android OS versions like from Android 4.4.2 KitKat to 6.0 marshmellow so there is no need of Camera 2 API but you won't get advanced and powerful features that're available on latest Pixel's Google Camera versions.

  

So, the old Google Camera versions will work best if you're using old Android versions or want to try out for nostalgia reasons but still there is a chance that your smartphone is not compatible with old Google Camera versions or you're lazy to try out them then don't worry for you there is one Google Camera developed by JAVIAN that supports most smartphones named Penguin's Google Camera.

  

Penguin Google Camera is modded version of an working old Google Camera that was designed to work on Samsung A51 then later on JAVIAN improved Penguin Google Camera by changing numerous UI elements and expanded supported smartphones list due to that right now Penguin Google Camera support almost all old and new 64bit Mediatek, Samsung Exynos, Qualcomm Snapdragon processor smartphones.

  

JAVIAN even added Google AR aka augmented reality support with mod version that can be replaced with Google Playground on Penguin Google Camera v5+ for that thanks to Celsoazevedo for helping him but do note there are only minor modifications and changes like JAVIAN added only few new UI elements from later versions of Google Camera not options and features, so do you like it? are you interested in Penguin Google Camera? If yes let's explore more.
