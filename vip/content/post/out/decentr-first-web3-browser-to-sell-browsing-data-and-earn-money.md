Internet is digital technology also known as world wide web is publicly released in year 1991 by Tim Berners Lee which previously used for US military operations where you can publish your digital website and blogs by hosting them on your computer or any cloud server and then once published you can open them using search engines like Google through supported browsers.

  

We so far seen two versions of internet, Web1.0 started in year 1991 where people used to create and host basic static websites and blogs on computers and then after a decade in year 2004 internet gone through alot of advancements due to that the era of Web2.0 started where people used to create and host modern and advanced websites and blogs on centralized cloud servers or content management platforms like Blogger and WordPress etc.

  

The drawback of Web1.0 and Web2.0 is people host thier websites and blogs on computers or single centralized server  that are either managed by individual or multiple companies due to that hackers can exploit centralized server to run down down your website or blog to gain access to your website database which they can publish online or sell on Darkweb that can cause privacy and security issues.

  

Now, we are gradually upgrading to Web3.0 a decentralized internet where people can create and host thier websites and blogs with decentralized domains on decentralized servers where your website or blog data will be divided and encrypted into numerous parts then hosted on many decentralized servers thus it's near to impossible to hack your website or blog including that you will never face slow speed or down time for sure.

  

Web3, decentralization of internet is not available in full scale yet there are many developers who developed and released Web3 products from past few years like decentralized crypto currencies, dVPNs and DeFi etc and many more useful and interesting Web3 products that are right now under development to make world wide web fully decentralized for best security and privacy for everyone.

  

Recently, we found an first fully decentralized open source Web3 browser named Decentr where you can sell your personal browsing data for money, usually most people don't like to show or sell thier personal private data to anyone they even use technologies like VPN and proxies etc to stay anonymous and protect privacy but there are some people who like to sell their personal data to earn money online.

  

Decentr is blockchain / metaverse browser that will store every browsing data of yours to Decentr ID aka Dec ID by using that you can sells your browsing data in return you will rewarded with DEC tokens each month from 300 000 DEC tokens pool as of now based on PDV - personal exchange rate aka which you can stake or become validator to earn more.

  

However, it's not compulsory to sell your browsing data on Decentr you will get an option to choose not sell data and do browsing with privacy and security with add ons support just like chrome on normal browser, so do we got your attention? are you interested in Decentr? If yes let's explore more.
