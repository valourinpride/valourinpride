Now a days, if you don't have operating system either it's on desktop for personal computers or smarphones it will be quite hard to manage life in this modern world of digital technologies thanks to number of companies who over the years created different operating systems to do various tasks with improvements in user interface and upgrade core features and options for better functionality to users every time.

  

PC aka personal computers long time back itself has CLI aka command line interface and GUI aka graphical user interface operating system basically softwares developed using numerous programming languages like Windows and Mac OS etc which are basic few decades back but now they're are quite advanced in association with powerful hardware that can do almost all real life tasks easily.

  

Smartphones which actually came into existence to replace keypad mobile phones also have operating systems like PCs which right now may not reached level of PCs advanced software and powerful hardware but they are designed to have potential and capability to do almost all tasks of PC which is why most people use smartphones more then PCs globally.

  

The main advantage is smartphones are small in size and handheld electronic devices like PDA aka personal digital assistant thus they are user friendly so you can simply carry them any where and any time which you can use to directly make calls and messages at the same time via operating system install more softwares to do tasks electronically and digitally.

  

There are number of operating systems available for smartphones over the years build by mobile companies around the world based on hardware specifications for compatibility but most of them are dis-continued with no further development due to various reasons mainly because they are unable to compete with Google's Android and Apple inc. iOS.

  

Even though, we do have few mobile operating systems that are still in development from mobile companies like Tizen OS of Samsung but Android and iOS occupied most smartphones and other electronic devices like smart TVs which is why mobile companies not showing much interest in reviving old mobile operating systems instead going with trend flow for commercial reasons worldwide.

  

Currently, Android has more then 70% world wide market share and remaining portion is mostly covered by iOS by this it's evident Android is dominant operating system for smarphones which most people use but some people like and prefer to use other old mobile operating system due to various different reasons mainly because of nostalgia.

  

Nokia is top mobile phone company originated in Finland which is known for manufacturing quality keypad mobile phones who also entered in smartphone business to stay up-to-date in trend and to supply the demand of customers in that process they developed some mobile operating systems and all of them were dis-continued and failed immensely.

  

Maemo is an free and open source mobile operating system modified version of desktop Debian linux distribution from Nokia developed for it's Internet tablets released in year 2005 and then later on upgraded to add support for smartphones in year November 11, 2009 they released Nokia 900 smartphone with Maemo 5 that can be used only in landscape mode like it's existing versions but it was amazing.

  

Maemo 5 is ahead of it's time with alot of features and options to name few double tap to wake and multi-tasking Integration of new technologies which are unavailable in its predecessos like Nokia 800/810 that we now see in modern smartphones and it has 1500+ free apps but Nokia terminated it in year 2011 and merged it with Moblin to release MeeGo OS a brand new free and open source operating system for number of entry level electronic devices mainly for netbooks, desktops and smartphones etc.

  

MeeGo is fabulous successor of Maemo OS developed by Nokia, Intel and Linux foundation which Nokia want to make it as primary operating system on smartphones but as in change of direction in favour of Tizen OS they discontinued MeeGo in year 2012 after that it's community forked it to create Mer that was discontinued but Jolla picked up and merged it to create Sailfish OS which is going on very well now.

  

Nemo Mobile is another fork of MeeGo OS but Mer is well known one, anyway Nokia didn't used them instead partnered with Microsoft to create mobile based Windows operating system for it's brand new Lumia smartphone series which is fantastic yet failed due to various reasons mainly because it's closed source and lack many required and necessary apps.

  

Meanwhile, Android and iOS already has millions of apps with ever increasing support from third party developers because of thier support and flexibility to easily create apps which is well known by Nokia but still they stubbornly didn't used it instead went on with Windows OS that eventually leaded to big losses and failure of Nokia smartphone sector failure itself.

  

Windows Phone or Mobile operating system is discontinued by both Nokia and Microsoft on it's smartphones but thanks to third party developers it's development is going on to keep it up to date like wise Maemo OS was also revived by third party developers as it's free and open source in year 2017 to create Maemo Leste 7.

  

Maemo Leste is free and open source community driven modernized version of Maemo 5 for smartphones and tablets released in year 2018 that continuing the legacy of Maemo which is based on Debian buster so if your missing out Maemo operating system then you can simply try out Maemo Leste for free.

  

Note : Maemo Leste is usable as daily driver that in order to use you must have supported devices like Nokia N900, Motorola Droid 4, Motorola Bionic, Pinephone, Pinetab, Allwinner tablets, virtual machine etc as it's in development phase but in future it will support more, so do you like it? are you interested in Maemo Leste?
