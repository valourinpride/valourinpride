Then, do remember indian government only banned chinese apps and games which can have data breach and privacy issues which have server in china.

  

So, pub g mobile and pub lite banned eventhough lite version is made by south korea company still it is published by tencent - Chinese company which hold 10% stake in pub g.

  

However, pub g pc not banned in India because it is founded and made by south korea company blue hole so you can play pub pc.
