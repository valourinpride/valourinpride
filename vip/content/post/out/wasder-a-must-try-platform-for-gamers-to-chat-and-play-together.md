Gamers love to collaborate with fellow gamers to play together and chat each other, this is why game developers like to  turn thier games from offline to online mode to create competitive, fun and cool experience on the go which will eventually lead to game growth in future.

  

However, if you don't have online mode on games then it is not possible to chat and play with fellow gamers, instead you have to play with computer, even if you have online games still it is little hard to find fellow gamers who like to chat and play with you, so if you don't find a partner of your choice then you have to play with system randomly selected players which is little dissapointing for gamers who play games with dedication and sincerity.

  

But, from past few years we got to see numerous platforms specifically created and dedicated to gamers like discord, while some gamers created groups on social messaging apps like Telegram and WhatsApp to gather gamers and play together and chat each other, including that there are many gaming platforms on internet yet most of this platforms are not upto the expectations and requirements of gamers as there are few missing features and drawbacks that should be addressed.

  

In this scenario, we have a workaround we are glad to present you an interesting gaming platform named Wasder where you can find games to chat and play with fellow gamers through match making automatically for multi-player games, even make new friends or invite your friends to party chats as this feature don't require your friends to be on Wasder, or else you can also invite friends to Friendshub to ramp up your gaming.

  

On Wasder, you can put all your favourite games on game spaces and share gaming clips that matters to you on custom feed by tagging fellow gamers, so do you like it? are you interested in Wasder? If yes let's know little more info about Wasder before we signup and explore more.
