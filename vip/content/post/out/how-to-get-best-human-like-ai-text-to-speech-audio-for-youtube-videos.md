When you tired of making YouTube videos due to extensive dubbing or you may want to create content in English eventhough it was not your primary language or may be your environment is not proper enough to create videos due to background sounds then you can use Text-to-speech to solve this issues in one go.

  

Text-to-speech is a software which will read your text so that you don't have to give voiceover anymore, but the problem with majority of Text-to-speech softwares and apps is they provide robotic speech in return which are not good and won't work for YouTube videos.

  

However, because of latest technologies like AI - artificial intelligence now we have many text-to-speech platforms which use AI to provide human like voice instead of robotic voice, but you have to choose the best artificial intelligence based platform so that you won't face issues later.

  

Eventhough most artificial intelligence based text-to-speech platforms are paid but some are available for free with few limitations like characters count or time etc, anyhow recently we are in search of best human like text-to-speech platform, fortunately we found IBM Watson.

  

IBM is well known American multinational company founded in June 16, 1991 which invented many core technologies that has allowed computers to advance further as time goes IBM now entered into numeous fields in technology, IBM started providing  cloud services to businesses and we pick  Text to speech service to generate human like audio, so are you ready? Let's begin.

**• How to get best human like artificial intelligence based text+to-speech audio using IBM Watson for free •**
