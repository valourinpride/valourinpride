There are numerous operating systems available for mobiles like Java, symbian, Android, iOS, FirefoxOS, Kai OS, Windows etc however Android and iOS are the only advanced and modern mobile operating systems created for latest smartphones with big market share around the world.

  

Eventhough iOS from Apple is known for best privacy and security yet it is closed software, while Google's Android is open source software which means developers and companies can utilise it to build thier own version of Android OS with additional features or changes as they like.

  

Android like any other mobile operating system includes thier company apps and services on it's software while most users has no issues with it but few people who don't trust Google states and believes that Google spying on users and gathering data with it's closed source apps and services.

  

However, there is no proof to validate and support those statements but incase if it's true then it can arise privacy issues which is why few developers who don't like and trust Google build thier own versions of Android OS using Android open source project aka AOSP with extra privacy and security features and no Google apps and services like Divest OS, GrapheneOS etc.

Recently, we re-visited another open source Android OS custom rom named /e/OS/ formerly known as Eelo created by Gaël Duval in 2018 based on LineageOS a fork of CyanogenMod and AOSP - Android open source project which has numerous features with no Google apps and services for extra privacy.

  

/e/OS is available out of the box on Murene smartphones which you can buy on [esolutions.shop](http://esolutions.shop), and if your device is officially supported then you can install /e/OS using [Easy installer](https://doc.e.foundation/easy-installer) beta desktop software, in case if you can't find your smartphone then check [list](https://community.e.foundation/t/release-plan-for-e-r-on-new-and-supported-devices/33802) of [un-official builds](https://community.e.foundation/t/list-of-unofficial-e-builds/17050) of /e/OS, still not found submit a [device proposol](https://community.e.foundation/c/e-devices/request-a-device) or build /e/OS custom rom for yourself and become device maintainer using this [guide](https://doc.e.foundation/rom-maintainer).

  

Note : In order to install /e/OS or any other custom rom you have to first unlock bootloader and install custom recovery like TWRP on your device using specific guides created for device from trusted portals like XDA and once done you can only install that /e/OS build which is specifically build for your device, if you install other /e/OS device builds on your device then it will hard brick or softbrick which is sometimes irrepairable.
