Sound is a form of energy that can be generated and transmitted through solid, liquid, gas basically wood, water, air etc when you make sound it travel along with them in wave format but the distance and width it covers depend on it's strength like for instance if you speak low then sound waves strength which is calculated in db aka decibels will be low so at the end you will recieve and hear sound low but if you  speak high then the sound waves will be strong so you will receive and hear sound high as well isn't cool and Interesting?

  

Even though, we have instruments to generate and transmit sound at super high wave lengths and decibals to cover long width and distances but extreme high ones will not just destroy your ear drums but also this world which is why it is always important to listen and hear to sounds at safe level decibals else it will be dangerous which is why experts suggest when you hear loud sound make sure to block your ear with fingers or any other material so that sound wave signal strengh will be reduced immensely.

  

Fortunately, each and every living being  and material has unique sound which will make different sounds of same based on how you or any other living force handle it at first humans who are known as people in modern society didn't care about sound but later on they not just recognised value but also tried to understood the potential and capability in that process many people created number of ways and methods to generate and transmit sounds for various purposes and usages worldwide.

  

Thankfully, people who seems to have more intelligence quotient in this world on planet earth then any other living beings used to generate different types of sounds either by themselves or through materials and instruments manually or automatically to make songs and music etc then later they even commericalized sounds in many ways like by performing them publicly as per people interests to make money and utilised in various different fileds due to that eventually found many more usage possibilities of sounds and they further eventually extenteded them drastically.

  

There are numerous categories of sounds created by nature or people and any other living beings yet they all comes under two sections which are good and bad sounds while the good ones are soothing to hear and listen and then bad ones are irritating and disturbing but not for everyone as it's all based up on perception and mood how they processed it in brain due to that some percentage of people may feel good about bad ones which are didn't liked by majority of people or other living beings globally.

  

However, In order to hear or listen any sounds few centuries back you have to be live present in place where the sounds are generating or transmitting in air or water and wood etc right? like for instance you want to listen opera music of some artist who is playing music basically sounds in some area or country then you have to go there which is not always possible right? so people around the world mainly since 19th century found number of machines  to record sound with microphone and play them with speaker anywhere and anytime quite conveniently amd comfortably.

  

Phonoautograph is first device to record sounds invented by Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville and then later on in year 1877  Thomas Edison build Phonograph that not just record sound but also play them back isn't cool? later on many inventors around the world build better machines to record and play sounds like casettes, 8bit tracks and compact digital discs etc but they're physical and analog ones including that they have few hardware drawbacks and restrictions like tapes and discs overtime will damage and you can only record and play limited time length sounds due to that not everyone like and it's disappointing?

  

In mid 19th century we got electronic computers evolution of mechanical based hardware computers which can execute real life tasks electronically on that back in year 1977 SoundStream company created an program basically software developed using number of programming languages named DAW aka Digital Audio Workstation that can not just record and play sounds but also edit and mix them very efficiently at first it was basic but eventually number of inventors and companies by adapting to latest technologies created better DAWs which are super cool and awesome.

  

Especially, when big size electronic computers slowly started evolved to small size home compatible PC aka personal computers in year 1980s by that time they are integrated with CLI aka command line interface and GUI aka graphical user interface operating system basically software in that process to adapt that number of companies build and released CLI and GUI based powerful and advanced DAWs along with simple ones to record or play audios which are actually sounds but as PCs play them digitally in connection  with software so they named it as audio and the term still used widely now.

  

DAW is big upgrade to digital sound recording that was started in early 19th century back in 1939 when Alec H. Reeves invented PCM aka pulse code module but PCs are still big so you can't easily carry and use them everywhere mainly when walking or running etc so large percentage of people around the world instead liked and preffered to choose pocket cassette and compact digital disc players so that they can easily record and play sounds on the go conveniently and comfortably.

  

But, many people didn't like cassette and digital disc pocket players as they don't play sounds digitally at that time in year 1990s we got PDA basically handheld computers so alot of people switched to them yet still for whatever reasons they are not widely used around the world and after long time in early 20th century Apple inc. build and released portable small size digital media player named iPod that can play sounds in many audio digital formats like AAC, MP3, WAV, AIFF, Apple lossless audiobooks, etc on the move easily.

  

iPod definitely replaced casette and compact disc players but at that time in early 21st century we got keypad mobile phones evolution of mobile phones and telephones which can not just record and play sounds but also make and receive telecom network calls and messages in addition with operating system like PC to install softwares yet at the end they are basic so to replace them Apple inc. build multi-touch display technology powerful closed source hardware and software smartphone named iPhone.

  

Apple inc. launched iPhone in year 2007 on January 9 which is evolution of keypad mobile phones that got huge attention and recognition around the world but as it's closed source most third party companies unable to use it instead they utilised open source hardware and software like Android from decade to build smarphones and sell them in developed and developing nations including that they upgraded smartphones by adapting to latest technologies due to that now we have modern smartphones.

  

Smartphones are now used in almost all fields and sectors it can do most tasks of PC in its own with flexibility accordingly including that they are widely used around the world to record and play audio digitally but you may know either it's smartphones or PCs they first process sound digitally into audio formats then play via hardware speaker isn't? but not everyone like to play sounds using speakers due to numerous reasons mainly because they may have bad speakers or don't want to let anyone listen or hear thier pre-recorded sounds and audios etc so such users usually use headphones or earphones they not just protect privacy but also surely give better sound and audio quality for sure.

  

Headphones provide a jack that you have to connect with sound players and then fit plugs in ear provided by headphones to start listening to sound and audio directly in your ear drums in this way sound won't leak outslde thus no one knows what you are playing inside isn't amazing? but do you know? the development of headphone dates back to year 1910 when Nathaniel Baldwin invented first pair headphones then after that many inventors around the world build different types of headphones by adapting to latest technologies due to that now we have modern headphones.

  

Modern headphones and it's evolution earphones available in different sizes and  types for number of electronic devices mainly used in PCs and smarphones they without jack also can wirelessly using bluetooth or WiFi technolgies can transfer and play sounds but the quality of audio that you get headphones from PCs and smartphones is based on several factors mainly audio file quality itself and then how your device hardware and software is processing it and speaker quality if any one of this is not properly done you won't get best quality on headphones which is it's always better to buy quality ones.

  

Now a days, we have thousands of premium quality headphones and smartphones but not everyone can afford it most people use budget or low end ones headphones and smartphones even in premium ones sometimes they don't properly process audio well so to fix this since long time many developers build Equalizer softwares where you can manually or automatically tune your devices audio to process right quality to your headphones or earphones according to your audio taste conveniently.

  

In sense, equalizer can improve audio quality at significant level but it's not easy as each device and headphones have different qualities you have to manually tune settings of equalizer to optimized and process best quality to headphones that takes time and you must have knowledge and skills on audio to do it correctly which is not everyone able to use equalizers but we do have some equalizer softwares which can automatically or using preset optimizations can process best audio quality on headphones completely.

  

  

Recently, we found an no root required Equalizer app for Android powered smartphones named Wavelet by pittvandewitt that provide auto equalizer, 9 band graphic equalizer, bass booster, reverberation, virtualizer, bass tuner, limiter, channel balance, with 3,300 pre-calculated optimizations for headphones for best audio quality timely, so do you like it? are you interested Wavelet?
