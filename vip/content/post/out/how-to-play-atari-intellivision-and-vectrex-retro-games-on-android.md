We are playing different types of games since ages isn't? and most of them require outdoor area and additional players which is common and they are designed in a way for fun and enjoyment but due to industrial revolution people begin working long time in companies and factories in making and 

using advanced and powerful machines to do various types of tasks for personal and commercial purposes due to that lifestyle changed and become busy making it hard to save time for playing outdoor games.

  

However, In the era of industrial revolution we got many revolutionary inventions out of them home gaming console is one first made by company Magnovox named the Odyssey which allows you to play digital video games on television or any other compatible electronic devices anywhere and anytime conveniently in your comfort  zone with flexibility, amazing isn't?

  

Fortunately, home gaming consoles gone through alot of advancements over the years with upgrades in hardware and software due to that now we have many modern home gaming consoles with powerful hardware and advanced software which can play heavy resources HD aka high definition graphic digital video games smoothly like Sony PlayStation series.

  

Now, we have modern home gaming consoles yet still some gamers from 1980s or 90s era want to play retro digital video games available on old home video gaming consoles for nostalgia reasons but it's manufactures stopped making and selling them long time ago yet you can buy few used ones on online digital stores at expensive price if available.

  

Even though, you can buy used old home video game consoles but most of them are unavailable including that now we are in era of modern personal computers and computers which are capable enough to play video games of almost all home gaming consoles using emulators for free so buying a home gaming console to play retro games is not smart decision for sure.

  

Personal computers and smartphones can't directly install home console digital  video games due to hardware and software differences but you can run them on compatible emulators softwares which provide an inside environment with plenty of additional options and features to run all supported retro video games smoothly.

  

Unofficial emulators are developed by third party developers who don't get any help from home digital video gaming console makers in developing unofficial emulators due to that they have to check and go through alot of things to develop an unofficial emulator with support to run

video games on personal computers and smartphones that's hard and takes time.  

  

Third party developers usually open source thier unofficial emulator on public repositories of collaborative development platforms like GitHub or GitHub etc so that with the help of contributions from fellow developers to get new features features and options with bugs fixes will fastrack optimizations of unofficial emulator and speed up the progress from alpha builds to stable ones as soon as possible.

  

Anyhow, recently we found an amazing open source smartphone emulator named Argon that has thousands of in-build classic and modern retro games catalogue of old home digital video gaming consoles like Atari 2600, 5200, Atari 7800, Atari 8-Bit, Atari Lynx, NES, ColecoVision, Vectrex, Intellivision with option to install from internal storage and Google Drive as well. 

  

The only drawback is Argon only allow you to install retro games roms from internal storage of phone only on public beta that will become premium feature in future but can install and backup classic and modern retro game roms from Google Drive cloud storage absolutely for free, fabulous isn't?  

  

Argon is still in early access phase which means development is in progress so you may find bugs or limited number of features but eventually Argon may fix all issues and release more interesting and exciting features in future, so do we got your attention? are you interested in Argon? if yes let's explore more.
