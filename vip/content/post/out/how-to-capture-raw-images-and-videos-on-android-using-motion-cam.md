In this world, in order to capture real life objects we use camera a revolutionary device build up of mechanical based hardware parts invented by Frenchman Joseph Nicéphore Niépce in year 1816 back then it was designed to capture only black and white photographs but later due to developments on camera from people and companies around the world we got black and white film camera which allows you to capture moving pictures.

  

Fortunately, after century on 15 April, 1935 Kodak released first Kodachrome film to use on 16mm camera and capture colour photographs after that many companies and inventors done alot of developments to capture color films in that process by year 1939 we got technicolor technology by using that you can capture color films which is first used in film Wizard of Oz.

  

Thankfully, inventors and companies rapidly adapted latest technologies into camera due to that we got 70 mm lens but all these film cameras of any size used to depend on hardware that was only able to capture RAW also known as unprocessed photographs and film footages which are real but as there is no enhancements you get mediocre photographs and films.

  

On traditional old cameras you have to capture photographs and film footages on negetive reels then manually process them using various methods in labs that require requires additional equipments and takes alot of time which is why inventors and companies for personal or commercial continously worked to build better camera technologies to instantly capture and view photographs and films.

  

However, Majority of them unable to make such cameras yet in that process we got many revolutionary camera technologies by using them first in year 1975 Eastman Kodak company engineer Steven Saason build world's first digital camera that can instantly capture photographs and films in various digital formats known as images and videos on hard drives which you can access and view on supported electronic devices like PCs aka personal computers.

  

Digital camera came in replacement to traditional cameras which use advanced and powerful technologies like sensors but still even digital cameras depended mainly on hardware and used to capture RAW images and videos but later alot of  inventors and companies globally started making thier own version of digital camera with new integrated technologies due to that we got modern digital cameras.

  

Modern digital cameras has high quality sensors with advanced hardware based mechanisms but instead of totally relying on hardware parts to capture images and videos modern digital camera utilise both hardware and software to capture at the same time apply some extra necessary enhancements in processing to improve quality of images and videos thus you won't get RAW.

  

But, RAW images and videos are very important to check real details especially in photography and film making so that you can apply your own enhancements using editing softwares which is why most companies on modern digital cameras  including supported lens and software to capture RAW images and videos.

  

Now majority of modern digital cameras has RAW support at both hardware and software level but on some electronic devices like smartphones which use modern digital cameras yet don't provide RAW image and video capture support due to hardware or software limitations which is totally fine and understandable.

  

iPhone is popular well known premium smartphone series from Apple Inc. which out of box provide RAW image and video capture support but on majority of Android OS smartphones you most likely won't find RAW support even if it has supported lens as mobile companies don't provide option or enable it to capture RAW images and videos on default camera softwares.

  

Even though, some mobile companies usually has software level RAW image and video capture support on Android powered smartphones but majority of them don't if you have such smartphone that has RAW image and video support but don't have an option on camera then you have to rely on  third party supported RAW camera apps.

  

Unfortunately, few years back there are no third party camera apps available on Android smartphones which can capture RAW image and videos even now you'll find very few third party camera apps out of them ON1 is top one but it only capture pro-grade RAW images not videos.

  

In sense, we don't have third party camera apps for Android smartphones to capture RAW videos but recently in search we found world's first camera app named MotionCam that can capture both images and video in RAW format with numerous features and manual controls on Android powered smartphones.

  

Motion Cam is an open source camera app developed by mirsadm that consumes RAW images and uses computational photography to reduce noise but you must have camera 2 API enabled and not supported on Exynos smartphones, so do you like it? are you interested in MotionCam? If yes let's explore more.
