World is full of wonders isn't it? when you go out of it you'll find space and universe over there you'll find more awesome wonders which can surely amaze you, If you are reading this then you must be human right? If yes then you may know as per scientific studies we have more IQ aka intelligent quotient in brain then any other living being on planet earth as of now.

Fortunately, thanks to highest levels of IQ in our humans known as people in modern society wherever you go and whatever you see and feel from each and everything you can think, analyze, imagine etc you will be able to gain information which is valuable as once you remember it in brain then it will become your knowledge which is more valuable than money as no one can steal it from you that's why knowledge is divine.

In sense, being human with right physical body parts mechanisms and structure with IQ you'll get potential and capability then with enough interest and effort you can understand about anything either it's simple or complex ones for sure such ability you won't usually see in other living beings in this world which is why since ancient times humans are dominating race on planet earth who not just developed and released revolutionary technologies but also various different systems and ideologies to manage natural and society sectors in this world efficiently.

But, the information or knowledge gained from any topic and through anyway if not shared will be limited to yourself without wide usage isn't? which is why since ancient times people using their mouth generated voice languages basically sound form communication to share knowledge with that back then you can only speak at moment and reach is limited to certain area and audience then later on people figured out better way to express voice languages in written form at first by carving with chesels on metals and rocks then writing with colors on cloths or leafs etc but handling them is not easy.

However, majority of people as there is no better choice got used to them but after long time eventually people found way to make paper out of tree wood pulp then using ink started writing on it which is simple and easy to use due to that people around the world begin using paper in bundle package known as books then started writing about their own personal or someone else knowledge to maintain it as private dairy or even become writer to sell them commercially world wide.

Generally, most people write all about themselves or gained knowledge and collected information on books to maintain as private dairy but there are certain percentage of people want to become writer who using their creativity write about their own or someone else biographies or stories etc according to their liking and preferences based on their writings skills on books then on their own sell them in offline stores commercially to make business and profits globally.

If you have own financial support then you can simply employ workers and machines to make handmade or printed copy books in large quantities and sell them on your own or associated and third party offline stores or anyone else but not everyone can afford them mainly new and small scale writers which is why most of them send thier book copies to big publishers as they can make then promote and market after  that then sell books to existing network of book stores around the world immensely.

Even though, big publishers usually have strong financial support with facilities and resources to sell and make business but getting approval is not easy task for that your book content must have better stuff then the already received which is hard that's why majority of new book writers few decades back due to lack of financial support and writing skills used to face hardships and struggle to sell and reach their books in full scale for sure.

Unfortunately, whoever have lack of funds and writing skills even at mediocre or pro level unable to get enough spotlight from people as books distribution is limited to few people or book stores but even if you have all resources still books making and distribution is long process even with a lot of workers with powerful and advanced machines that takes time and patience but that was later on simplified in 19th century with the entry of electronic computers.

Computer is hardware mechanical machine used to execute real life tasks mechanically that was eventually changed when it was powered up by electricity and Integrated with operating systems basically softwares developed using numerous programming languages which can execute real life tasks electronically and digitally by using them you can write books in electronic and digital format then simply distribute them extensively.

in year 1971 inventor Michael Stern Hart launched project Gutenberg then digitized the U.S. Declaration of Independence with a Xerox mainframe computer which is noted as first e-book after that number of inventors started creating e-book of physical books at first they used to sell them in offline book stores then after few decades not only the way people make and distribute ebooks but also how they get and read them simplified and changed drastically thanks to world wide web.

Tim Berners Lee in year 1991 developed and released WWW aka world wide web browser software for computers that can access public contents of internet which are in website format basically software developed using programming languages like .html, css, javascript etc due to that a lot of people using their computer build different types of websites then with the computer storage and memory created server to host on internet, isn't cool?

Internet build by ARPANET in year 1969 at first used to be private and primarily only able to send digital messages between computers but when world wide web was released it got millions of websites in that we also got to see online book stores over there you can simply upload your e-books or it's evolved version audio books for free or paid to make business worldwide.

Thankfully, numerous developers created and released amazing softwares to make and read e-books and audiobooks mainly on home compatible small size PCs aka  personal computers due to that people were able to utilise maximum potential and capability of online book stores and the main advantage and flexibility of them is once e-books or audio books uploaded on computer server and displayed on website you can access and download unlimited digital copies of same e-book digital files conveniently and comfortably.

Online books stores got thumping success world wide people without spending penny can make e-books and audio books with free softwares then distribute on them after that people across the world simply can access and download e-book or audio books from online stores using url aka uniform resource locator also known as link from browsers of computers then using softwares to read e-book or audio book anywhere and anytime on the go.

Now a days, almost all people reading e-books and audio books on smartphones which is evolution of keypad mobile phones and telephone with functionality  to make direct telecom network calls yet has operating system that has capability to do all tasks of PC in it's own way where you you will find alot of e-book and audio book reader softwares but most of them don't provide certain features and options to manage e-book and audio books well.

Usually, if you are avid reader of books then you may probably have small or big  library over there you may set and manage books in order according to writer, genre and category etc right? to keep it simple as possible for you isn't it? even you can bookmark and highlight texts in books to keep track of them or arrange them based on months or years etc, but if you choose to maintain e-books and audio books then you must have reader software so that you can manage and track them effectively.

Recently, we found an fabulous e-book and audio book reading tracker and manager app for smartphones that definately need more spotlight named Bookmory which has almost all options and features with book shelf to organize and manage your e-books and audiobooks efficiently, so do you like it? are you interested in Bookmory If yes then let's explore more.
