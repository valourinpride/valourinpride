If you are searching for the way to create eos 

wallet well you probably want the simple way while the eos support many coins mainly the ecoin said to be growing large scale.  

  

Whatever, let's see how you make eos wallet in three ways.

  

1\. Freewallet.com

  

Freewallet.com is one the easiest way that you can create ecoin wallet there are many wallets available for free you just have to create account and login search for eos wallet - add the wallet and it's done.

  

2\. Wombat

  

Wombat app is available for fee in playstore you get many features like daap browser and many other coins available and you will have the public and private address while public address is free but private address is paid for about approx 3$

  

3\. Lumi 

  

The best wallet I seen. Lumi provies simple and material look and usability is simple with alot of features app has eos wallet option but you can't create wallet but you can import with private key if you already have the account.
