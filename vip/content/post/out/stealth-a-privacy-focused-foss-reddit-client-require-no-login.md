Internet is protocol developed by ARPANET that provides an unique address known as IP aka internet protocol address to every computer to communicate with each other and share files etc but at first it used to be private so users have to manually get access from other computer due to limited access you can't use it widely.

  

However, in year 1991 inventor Tim Berners Lee build browser basically software named WWW aka world wide web that will let you access public contents of internet was released on world's first internet site : [info.cern.ch](http://info.cern.ch) on April 30, 1993 after that many people started creating and hosting various websites and digital platforms on computers and cloud servers then published on Internet so that people can access them using World Wide Web.

  

In intial release of world wide web known as web 1.0 websites and digital platforms are very much basic like people used to make HTML websites but later when people upgraded to Web 2.0 we got modern websites and digital platforms which use several programming languages in that process Andrew Weinreich on May, 1996 released world first true social media platform [Sixdegrees.com](http://Sixdegrees.com).

  

On social media platforms you can digitally connect with people and message or call them so you don't have to use traditional communication methods but at first in beginnings social media platforms don't have many features but eventually alot developers and companies added numerous features adapting to latest technologies timely due to that we got modern social media platforms.

  

There are amazing modern feature rich social media platforms that we use on daily basis like Telegram, Instagram, Facebook, Reddit but all of them require you to make account else you can't access them which is understandable as the 

primary goal of any social media platform is to increase userbase but the problem here is they rely on centralized servers.  

  

Now a days we are slowly upgrading world wide web to web 3.0 where websites and other digital platforms data is splitted into numerous parts then encrypted using strong secure format like AES-256 after that they'll be hosted on decentralized servers around the world thus your website or digital platforms will run 24/7 without downtime and it's near to impossible for hackers and law enforcement agencies to hack access your private data which is hosted on decentralized servers.

  

But, most modern social media platforms still use centralized servers that are managed by one or multiple companies to host user data base like personal details which are less secure then decentralized servers and prone to hacking so if you want top notch privacy and security then it's better to don't use social media platforms that use centralized servers.

  

Currently, it's very hard to stay away from social media platforms which use centralized servers as Web 3.0 digital platforms are not available in full scale so at any point you may have to use them for personal or work reasons because most people around the world use centralized servers social media platforms.

  

Reddit is a popular social media platform founded by Steve Huffman, Alexis Ohanian, and Aaron Swartz in year 2005 also use centralized servers they may move to decentralized servers in future, even though most social media platforms including Reddit use secure centralized servers yet there is risk of your personal data submitted on Reddit is targeted and exploited and hackers isn't?

  

Generally, it's ethical to use any social media platforms by creating an account if you care so much about safety of your personal data online then it's totally fine to use them without creating account but almost all social media platforms including Reddit don't allow you to access it's contents without user account thus you most likely have no other way.

  

Recently, we found an free and open source feature rich Reddit client named Stealth that let you access Reddit without account even it don't have login option so you don't have to submit personal details thus you'll get privacy and security, so do you like it? are you interested in Stealth?
