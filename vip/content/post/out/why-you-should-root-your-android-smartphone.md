On PC, you can easily edit system level files and use softwares as superuser by clicking on run as administrator but on Android in order to edit system level files and run apps as superuser you have to install rooting softwares after unlocking bootloader which voids warranty

**\- SUPERSU AND MAGISK -**

  

We have numerous Android rooting softwares out there on internet but the most popular one is Supersu by chainfire which supports majority of Android smartphones but chainfire discontinued Supersu in 2018 and then we got modern rooting software named Magisk from developer john wu with advanced features from then Magisk become one stop destination to root any latest smartphones.

**\- READ / WRITE SYSTEM FILES -**

  

There are many advantages by Rooting Android but the main one is you can access and edit system aka root level files to customize, remove or add your own features that are not available including that you can also add and remove even sharing system level files is possible.

**\- REMOVE OEM APPS -**

  

Android is open source project aka AOSP developed by Google thus anyone can build thier own version of Android and use it on thier smartphones so most mobile companies install Android software on it's smartphones including thier own apps as system so that you can't uninstall them which occupy alot of storage and many people consider them as bloatware.

**\- ROOT FOLDER -**

  

If you want to uninstall unnecessary system apps aka bloatware then you must have to root your Android smartphone and then simply use any file manager you like I suggest Mixplorer to open /root folder where you can easily access and remove system apps in one click.

But, remember make sure you don't remove such system apps that are required and directly connected to software, if you accidentally or mistakenly remove any key functionality system apps which are needed by Android device to work properly then it will hard or soft brick your smartphone which is irreparable sometimes.

**\- SUBSTRATUM -**

  

Even though many custom skinned Android softwares like MiUI and HiOS etc allows you to install custom themes without root yet incase if you're using pixel smartphones or stock roms then by rooting Android you can install cool and amazing custom themes via theming engines like Substratum.

**\- MODULES -**

  

You can also install modules by rooting Android to customize or get new features, on your smartphone now a days most people using Magisk modules but the problem with Magisk is it's repository is discontinued so you have to search and get modules from internet to install on Magisk manager, anyhow there are many popular module repositories alternative to Magisk like Xposed, LSposed etc.

**\- SOUND MODS -**  

  

One of the major prospect of rooting Android is It is possible to tweak, enhance and increase headphones and speaker sound by just installing modules or rooted apps, even you can install Sony Dolby Atmos on any Android smartphone which is normally only available on Sony and partnered smartphones.

**• RUN ROOT APPS - **

  

Foremost, many users root Android to install that apps which only work on rooted smartphones to name a few for instance busybox to install tiny unix utlilites, Battery Guru or Greenify to increase an optimize battery life, App2SD Pro to increase system storage aka ROM or RAM by swaping SD card, performance tweakers, app backups etc.

**\- CPU / GPU -**

  

While, some users and developers root Android to increase CPU and GPU mhz to increase performance and play games at better FPS but modifying CPU and GPU is very risky as if you don't know what you're doing then in long run your CPU and GPU will become slow and become not usable, anyhow you can change CPU and GPU as well but always set it at safe levels.

**\- DEBUG APPS -**

  

Especially, developers root Android devices to debug and test apps or softwares to find out bugs as on rooted Android devices you can edit system files, modify app data as per requirements anytime which is not possible on non-rooted Android so if you don't want to root Android then they have to depend on PC or Android studio.

**\- GOOGLE CAMERA -**

  

Google camera aka GCam you may probably heard of it's a camera app developed specifically for Google's pixel smartphones which is not available on other smartphones but thanks to amazing developers who first struggled to port Gcam to other devices but over the time it is now possible to install on any rooted Android smartphone by simply enabling camera 2 Api.

  

GCam uses it's own software algorithm to drastically increase picture quality even if the camera hardware is not top notch, now with Gcam ports and mods from talented developers around the world we can experience Google camera exclusive features like super nightmode, potriats, astrophotography etc on any Android smartphone, isn't this cool and awesome?
