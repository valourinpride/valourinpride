Do you know computers? you may probably already know them if you don't then for you they are created in early 18th century at the time of industrial revolution which are build using number of hardware parts with mechanisms due to that they're known as machines at first the founder of computer Charles Babbage build world's first computer named Difference Engine that calculate and tabulate polynomial functions after that many inventors by adapting to latest technologies build many different types of computers for various purposes which can run real life tasks automatically and mechanically.

  

Fortunately, In mid 19th century some inventors created electronic computers which instead of relying on humans to run it's mechanisms depend and powered by electricity due to that they are able to run designated tasks more efficiently and then in some years few inventors succeeded in executing digital software on processor of electronic computer which are created using number of programming languages due to that not only flexibility but also 

potential and capabilities of electronic computers increased immensely.  

  

In begginings electronic computers are only able to run tasks electronically but when digital softwares are implemented on them it is able to do them digitally for instance inventors used to add operating system on computer that can install more softwares at first they used to run tasks electronically but later on in year 1960s  we got CLI - command line interface and then in year 1970s we got GUI - graphical user interface operating system because of them electronic computers were able to execute and show tasks digitally.

  

But, majority of computers back then used to run tasks like sending digital messages between computers and numerous other custom softwares at that time in year 1962 Steve Russel of MIT created world's first moving graphics video game named SpaceWar which is basically software then after that many inventors build numerous video games due to that people were not only able to run softwares but along them they can play many amazing video games as well comfortably and conveniently.

  

Even though, Computer have both softwares and moving graphics video games but back then they are not only big in size of car but also super expensive due to that they are mostly limited to some companies like IBM which is why majority of people unable to afford them unless they are millionaires even if they do still as computers are not home compatible it is hard to arrange enough space for them which is why most people unable to get and play video games on computers.

  

Meanwhile, many people around the world don't even know about video games on  computers at that time most people used to play games on machines even if they know still buying computer and playing it's video games is not easy but alot of them really want to play computer video games so to provide two inventors Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney in partnership as Syzygy Engineering company build and released world's first commercial Computer video game machine named ComputerSpace.

  

ComputerSpace is undoubtedly revolutionary machine which is designed for offline stores with pay and use system thus people can drop few coins to get certain amount of time to play computer video games same as arcade game machines due to that people whoever can't buy computer because of financial conditions or may be they don't like or prefer as it's not gaming centric can use ComputerSpace but due to various factors and reasons it failed commercially.

  

However, the template of ComputerSpace is widely utilised by numerous companies around the world who developed thier own custom computer video game machines by using and adapting to different latest technologies accordingly with numerous new in-build video games which are quite amazing and better then arcade games that's why most people around the world eventually shifted to computer video game machine games isn't cool?

  

Especially, many kids got used to computer video game machines but it is not always possible to go offline stores or wherever it's available for anyone which is why back in year 1972 Magnavox company developed and released home video game console that you can simply connect to Television and then start playing in-build video games easily after that number of companies developed and released thier own custom custom home video gaming consoles upgrading options and features by adapting to new technologies due to that now we have modern powerful and advanced home video game consoles.

  

Now in 21st century we have modern home video game consoles like to name few Sony PlayStation and Microsoft Xbox etc by using them you can Install and play high resolution and definition huge size heavy resources graphics intensive cool and fantastic video games smoothly which is why most people going after them but few people like and prefer to buy old home console video games mainly because of nostalgia reasons ain't you one of them.

  

If you're someone who want to play old home console video games then you may have to buy them which is hard now as companies stopped manufacturing them long time ago but there are some online and offline stores where you can buy few old home video games consoles but as they are rare you may definitely have to pay expensive price for them which is not possible for everyone isn't disappointing?

  

In case, you want to buy old home video game consoles to collect and protect them in your personal arena or public places like museums then it's fine but if you want them to play video games in home then wait it's not worthy now as you can play almost all old even new home console video games using emulator softwares available on PC aka personal computers and smartphones extensively.

  

Usually, it is not possible to directly install and run home console video games on PCs and smartphones due to hardware and software differences which is why emulator softwares are developed in supported format using number of compatible programming languages then developers will implement hardware of home console video game in emulator software thus you are able to play home console video games but it's not easy.

  

In sense, emulators provide an inside digital necessary virtual hardware and software environment of home video game console in it's software where you can sideload video games and play them which is like nutshell or operating system  or to be exact virtual box due to that you can use them normally as you run PC softwares and smartphones etc.

  

There are mostly unofficial emulators developed by third party developers who very likely don't have any connection with companies thus they won't get any help or support in developing unofficial emulators due to that third party developers have to manually make many digital files carefully then test and debug emulator softwares to find and fix bugs found by himself or as per reports of users while using emulator software or playing video games that takes time which is why most unofficial emulators take atleast few years to reach phase and level of stability.

  

Thankfully, almost all third party developers from past one decade releasing thier unofficial emulators as free and open source via public repositores on contributive development platforms like GitHub where anyone on web can commit thier code to collectively upgrade and update unofficial emulators with required optimizations and enhancements due to that it is now taking bit less time to get stable unofficial emulators for sure.

  

The another advantage of free and open source unofficial emulators is their code can be used by anyone to make their own own custom home console video game emulator with additional modifications to provide better functionalities due to that now we are getting unofficial home video game console emulator ports and clients of PC for smartphones and vice versa that will increase customization drastically.

  

Anyhow, generally PCs are more compatible with emulator softwares mainly new ones then smartphones as they have more powerful hardware and and software most third party developers prefer and like to focus on making un-official emulators for PCs but from past few years they are also concentrating on getting them on smartphones.

  

We are from last decade using smartphones every where to point it is struggling to manage our day without them which are basically evolution of keypad mobile phones and telephones but has operating system that can do almost all tasks of PC including that companies regularly upgrading smartphones storage and memory etc due to that now a days third party developers trying to make or port existing or new unofficial emulators for smartphones so we may surely get their support in near future.

  

Anyhow, if you want to classic graphical point-and-click adventure and RPGs home console video games they are old and basic due to that third party developers already build and released many stable unofficial emulators with numerous options and features for smartphones as they' are old classic games you can easily play them so are you ready?

  

Recently, we found an free and open source unofficial emulator named ScummVM for Android powered smartphones named ScummVM that can play ScummVM classic graphical point-and-click adventure and RPGs home console video games so do you like it? are you interested in ScummVM?
