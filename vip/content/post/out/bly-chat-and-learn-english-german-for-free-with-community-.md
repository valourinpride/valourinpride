English is international language, so if you know english you can explore all the world and get job opportunities available around the globe as English is considered as very important language to know which is able to  break language barriers due to that all the countries try to teach english to thier people for thier growth and development to compete with modern world.

  

So, Do you have interest to learn English then we have numerous apps & websites available out there on internet like duolingo and 101 english podcast etc while most of the English learning apps & websites have pre-made videos and pre-programmed lessons which will not give you real life language learning feel and experience which is surely a drawback.

  

However, if you want real life language learning feel and experience by chatting with real people then we have a solution we found a app named bly where you can not just learn and improve english but also german by chatting with bly community for free without registration so you will get  anonymity and privacy.

  

bly will be very useful to those who have interest to learn German as Germany is the only country where english is considered as secondary language and German is considered as primary language as most educational institutions teach subjects in German language and even for superior jobs German language is enough so there is no need of English language officially, so if you want to learn German then bly can be very helpful to you.

  

In bly language learning app currently you can only chat and learn english, german with the community as bly is currently in early access phase you may find bugs & issues, eventhough bly is right now limited interms of languages support and features but in future bly releases it may support more languages and features, so do we got your attention on bly?
