Most people in this world want privacy which is why privacy is one of the basic human rights declared by united nations commission on human rights due to that majority of countries and states since long time made numerous laws in thier country constitution with time to time revisions for better protection of privacy and security.

  

Generally, each country can have it's own privacy protection laws for it's people based on several factors like political conditions but it become difficult to protect privacy in 21st century because of advanced and powerful electronics and digital technologies which is why they're continuously taking strict measures by implementing new improved privacy laws yet still criminals using numerous illegal methods to compromise privacy of people and security of country that can cause personal or financial looses.

  

Especially, on electronic devices like computers and smartphones which has operating system basically software where you can open and install digital softwares and technologies created by developers and companies using many programming languages for various purposes mainly to do real life tasks electronically or digitally that's cool but the problem with them is 

they are not fully safe.  

  

Usually, majority of reliable companies try to make secure hardware and software to use on computers and smartphones but there is possibility that it can have small or big loopholes and bugs which are fixable as per company schedules but prior that get fixed black hat hackers using existing high tech technologies injecting malware or virus into loopholes to spy or track even extract your personal data anonymously.

  

Now a days it's hard to inject spyware on software as software marketplaces for Instance smartphone app stores analysing softwares using advanced technologies to check any suspicious code even if any app somehow bypassed security checks yet some day it will removed including that people also regularly notified about risks involved in installing softwares from third party sources to protect your privacy

  

But, there is legal way that all software developers use to gather personal data and monitor users via software terms of service and policies mentioned required software permissions and data trackers for personal or commercial reasons which will displayed to you thus you can deny or accept as it's completely transparent you have full ability and authority to stop or continue using such softwares.

  

However, some developers implement heavy personal data grabbing trackers and monitors into softwares which are usually mentioned in terms of service if published on trused marketplaces which you may don't like as that software may be sending your personal data to unwanted countries or collecting extensive data but still you if like that software for any reasons in that case you have to stop it's data trackers as you consider them as spyware, isn't?

  

There is an misconception that VPN aka virtual private network softwares which are used tunnel device traffic to secure and encrypted cloud server of another country stop data trackers trackers that's not sure as majority of VPNs only tunnel your data traffic but some VPNs can fully stop data trackers if supported and configured like Windscribe else you have to use some other ways.

  

It is hard to manually open softwares to remove encrypted or unencrypted data tracker spyware or we can say stalkware unless your developer with knowledge and skills on reverse engineering but thankfully alot of developers already made numerous Antistalker softwares to stop data trackers on computers and smartphones.

  

Even though, we have many Antivirus softwares but they only from malwares and virus not from suspicious software permissions and data trackers for them you have use Antistalker softwares as they provide alot of features specifically for that purposes to keep you in safe zone and get rid of privacy leeching softwares.

  

Recently, we found an app named Antistalker that can automatically scan and detect apps which are unusually enabling your smartphone permissions then notify you including that it has ability to stop data trackers in sense spyware or stalware of both system and private apps but remmember alot features require paid subscription so do you like it? are you interested in Antistalker?
