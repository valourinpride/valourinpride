Wherever you go in this world sound will be there like air and both are invisible and interconnected like for instance when you talk with voice or shoot bullet through gun etc you will get sound which is in waves format will instantly travel along with air based on the strength known scientifically as decibels in modern times the highest it is the more width and distance it will cover and go which almost everyone know isn't? but more you will explore about sound it will be quite exciting and Interesting!

  

The ability to make and listen to sounds which is possible with ears since ancient times considered as important and fruitful as you can not only communicate but also listen to fellow people including that each and every living being talk voice sound is different and unique and same applies to physical objects based on material each one on how you or nature will handle according to movements of air as it's the only carrier of sound will travel at various flexible frequencies and ranges etc due to that you can generate unlimited different sounds from them which is why it has and have immense potential and capability to do almost everything on the go.

  

There are difference types of sounds but can be categorized into two sections they are good and bad sounds, the good ones will be soothing to hear and listen anytime and anywhere and then comes bad ones which are quite disturbing and irritating but it is subjective to each person based on how they will process and think about sound signals in brain known as mood so for some people even bad sounds feel like good ones which is why each living being react differently to sounds when you ask any random person about particular sound they may give number of different opinions and reviews, have you ever done this?

  

Fortunately, since ancient times humans known as people in modern society given attention and recognised value of sound and tried to understand it's potential and capability as much as possible due to that people created different types of sounds for various purposes at first majority of people used sound for personal usages but as times goes they started commercializing sound like by making musics and songs based on thier skills then by performing them in various public and private places like political events or concerts etc with pay money and listen or see model then later on for accountability or verification people created and Introduced ticketing system which is still used globally.

  

But, In order to listen sounds of nature and fellow living beings created in anyway you have to be present in live at that particular area as sounds as said earlier travel in air according to it's strength calculated in db aka decibels if the decibel level of sounds are low they will travel limited width and distance but if the decibel level of sounds are high then they will for sure travel more width and long distance yet still you won't find such sounds at big decibels which will travel around the world unless a planet or comet approaching planet earth as if such sound exists they either destroy the world or your ear drums which is why you always have to listen sounds at safe decibel levels to always stay and be in safe zone.

  

However, it is not always possible to go somewhere from your location to listen sounds of people or other living beings like animals or birds etc who making different types of sounds like music or songs with voice or instruments etc they are known as musicians or singers even speeches or dialogues etc in live or films at different location or country etc as it's not only hard but also travelling or tickets costs are super expensive which is why many people out of necessity from past few centuries invented many super cool and revolutionary machines and devices which are designed and build to not only record sounds but also play them anytime and anywhere isn't pretty fantastic?

  

Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville is known to be the first person to invent and patent world first hardware mechanical parts machine for sound recording named Phonaautograph in year 1857 on March 25 then later on after 20 years in year 1877 Thomas Alva Edison invented world's first machine that record sound and also play them back named Phonograph due to that they received wide and huge attention with recognition from people worldwide.

  

Phonograph also known as gramophone was further developed and modified by number of inventors to fix drawbacks and improve for better sound record and play back out of them to name one Alexander Graham Bell and at the end for more then half century Phonograph was widely used by almost all people around the world but in year 1960s many inventors build better machines to record sound and play them back like 8 track and casette tapes etc.

  

Thankfully, since 1970s many companies invented numerous better sound record and playback machines but most of them are physical analog ones they record sound to tapes with them you can only record and play sound under limit like upto 120 minutes including that when you re-use them frequently there is high chance that tape in cassette may get mold so if you don't fix then it will damage after that you have no choice other then to replace them which is lengthy process isn't?

  

In year 1980s digital compact disc got popularity though they first started in year 1960s which are way better then cassette tapes as it records sound and play it back with disc not tapes since then numerous companies around the world developed thier own custom digital compact disc - CD players at first they are big designed for homes but later on many companies as per demand from large percentage of people to supply them build and released small pocket size CD players so that you can listen to pre-recorded sounds while walking, running and traveling easily.

  

Even though, we have pocket players for cassete tapes as well but digital compact disc technology is better yet still digital compact disc has few drawbacks like for instance when you re-use frequently and roughly without proper care CDs will be scratched and eventually get damaged when it happens you may no longer can use them including that digital compact disc is big and has number of limitations like it can only store few sound files each upto 90 minutes time due to that whenever you want to listen new sound you have to put another digital compact disc in the CD player which takes time and you can't take numerous compact discs along with you so alot of people whoever didn't like digital compact discs and CD players and want better alternative to record and play sound eventually shifted to electronic computers.

  

We are not talking about mechanical computers but the electronic computers powered by electricity invented in mid 19th century which is capable of executing real life tasks electronically, anyway thought the development of digital audio recording dates back to October 3, 1938 with PCM aka pulse code module but really got big kickstart back in year 1977 when company Soundstream build DAW aka Digital Audio Workstation a program basically software developed using numerous programming languages for electronic computers that can digitally record, mix, edit, play audios

which are basically sounds but as DAW is digitally playing them in-connection with software in numerous digital formats it was named as audio at first it's basic but later on numerous companies build and released thier own DAW adapting to latest new technologies in that process we got powerful and advanced DAWs now.

  

When big electronic computers back in 1970s and 1980s slowly started becoming home compatible known as PC - personal computers then they are also Integrated with CLI aka command line interface and GUI aka graphical user interface operating 

systems basically visible digital software that we can see on monitor and control with keyboard or mouse pointer easily at that time many developers also build and released digital CLI and GUI based DAWs including that numerous developers also build and released simple PC softwares to play with the audios which all at the end are capable of converting, editing, playing audios in numerous formats efficiently.

  

PCs with it's hardware and software is capable of editing and playing thousands of audios by storing them on it's hardware storage provided by HDDs aka hard drive disks or SDDs aka static drive disks but PCs are big as well they are designed for homes as PCs are not handheld you can't easily use them while walking or running etc which is why people not for editing or recording audios for that PC is fabulous but for listening music outdoors majority of people back in 1980s and 1990s used to depend and rely on traditional or digital cassette taps and players everyday.

  

Meanwhile, there are alot of people who strongly don't like to use neither casettes or compact disc players so back in time PDAs aka personal digital assistants are getting into spotlight which are basically computers but handheld ones so people whoever want computers but also want to record and play audios on move started using PDAs including that there are some PDAs with them you can make and receive telecom network calls and messages but for whatever reasons PDAs are not widely used by audiophiles instead they choosed amazing digital portable media players.

  

In early 20th century, Apple inc. well known PC maker in year 2001 on October 23 released iPod a revolutionary small size portable digital media player comes with 8 giga byte hardware storage to let you store and play thousands of audio files which are in compatible digital format like AAC, MP3, WAV, AIFF, Apple Lossless etc and yeah all of them you can simply carry in your pocket and then play anywhere and anytime on iPod it will handle efficiently.

  

iPod is world's tiny size first portable digital media player which got success commercially but it has some drawbacks like it has limited hardware storage with no support for external storage including that you can't do anything else other then playing audio files yet it inspired number of companies worldwide who developed and released thier own external storage supported better features and options iPods which are cool and fantastic.

  

In just one year after release of Apple inc. iPod, few companies started making and releasing keypad mobile phones which is basically evolution of mobile phones and telephones that can record and play digital audio format files including that it comes with operating system basically software like PCs but they are very basic as well so to replace them Apple inc. back then build world's first multitouch display technology smartphone named iPhone was launched by it's founder Steve Jobs in year 2007 on January 9 named iPhone which has closed source hardware and software so number of third party companies as there is choice they relyed on open source hardware and software like Android from search engine giant Google then selled them worldwide due to that now people around the world extensively using smartphones.

  

Smartphones are handheld electronic device which is considered as evolution of keypad mobile phones but can do almost all tasks of PC like PDAs in it's own way as both have similar hardware and software where you can not just record and play but also stream audios which is why majority of people who want to play audios on go mainly using smartphones over portable media players, PDA, PCs and many more. 

  

Anyhow, if you are here then probably you are not getting enough quality audio on your smartphone isn't? you will now know why foremost in order to record sound at best quality you need quality microphone and then once it records your sound it has to be processed correctly by hardware and software to get best audio digital formats then after that you need to have good speakers to get original recorded audio sound quality but the issue here is most smartphone makers don't put enough focus on them instead they focus and target other sectors of smartphones.

  

Especially, most budget and low end smartphones comes with cheap microphone and speakers due to that not just your recorded sound will have low audio quality and volume but also other audio files provided by anyone will get same fate that's why when buying smartphone you also have to give equal importance to quality of them but in case you already have one smartphone that has poor audio quality then you can't much with in-build mic or speaker unless you're technician but you can do some changes and modifications to software of your smartphone which will improve audio quality to significant level for that you have to root smartphone which voids device warranty unless you live in EU.

  

Rooting is software when executed on smartphone will unlock system level access that was previously locked by OEM for security and privacy as modifying any system files of smartphones will end up hard or soft bricking your smartphone which is why most people stay away from it but using it properly will let you unlock restrictions due to that you can extend the potential and capabilities like for instance once you root you can make right changes and modifications to software where the audio is processing to improve headphone or speaker audio quality immensely.

  

iPhone comes with closed source and ecosystem hardware and software named  iOS that even after rooting known as Jailbreak still you can't modify it extremely but when it comes to Android as it's free and open source known for customization by default itself by rooting it you can easy change and modify system files according to your liking and preferences to improve digital audio quality effectively.

  

Once you want to root Android for that you have to unlock bootloader of smartphone so make sure to do them in right way by following correct instructions from trusted platforms like [XDA](http://xda-developers.com) specifically created for your device and don't forget to root your Android with Magisk as it's now latest technology and best replacement of SuperSu then you can start modifying system files of Android to improve audio or anything else but it is hard and you may probably don't know how to do it isn't? 

  

Thankfully, from past few years to simplify process number of developers aready created numerous softwares for Android powered smartphones to improve audio for headphones and speakers which you can install on custom recoveries like teamwin recovery project and rooting softwares like Magisk but out of them Dolby Atmos is awesome which is OEM software technology and build exclusive for Sony smartphones but few developers succeeded in porting it to almost all Android devices so that you get benefits and enjoy it's surround sound happily.

  

Dolby is undoubtedly one of the best sound engine module to get best audio quality of any category on smartphones  but there are many alternative sound engines available for Android like ainur narsil, jamesdsp, viper4android, Supmix for better spatial audio etc which you can install individually on Magisk or TWRP but if you want to try all of them at once then you have use another module named AML aka audio compatibility patch then test them as each smartphone react differently based on specifications and once you will get idea and best settings to improve audio you can proceed further.

  

Generally, it is not required to Install numerous sound engine modules on your android smartphones unless you are an audiophile and want to tune digital audio in different ways by customizing settings and options etc like pro, anyway now we will share best sound engine modules for Android powered smartphones which you can directly flash them in TWRP or Magisk and use now, so do you like it? are you interested? If yes let's explore more.
