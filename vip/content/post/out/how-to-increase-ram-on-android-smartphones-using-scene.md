Random access memory inshort RAM is basically volatile memory that stores data in background temporarily until it get power supplied on electronic devices at first in beginning RAM used to be small size yet it's enough as back in time we used to have minimal capacity electronic devices but as time goes we got powerfull and advanced ones so in order to handle them in parallel many companies created  and integrated modern RAMs though there are numerous different types of RAM but the latest one that since past few decades and now most people around the world using is double data rate dynamic RAM inshort DDR which over the years gone through continuous developments due to that now we have DDR 5th generation at the end DDR is modern and big in size that can hold and run data more efficiently.

  

Meanwhile, static ram aka S-RAM uses transistors to hold and run data which is faster and doesn't refresh data but it's quite expensive and most device makers at present usually integrate S-RAM on limited and high end electronic devices where is DDR RAM use both transistors and capacitors to hold and run data which has refresh rate of few milliseconds so you won't notice it that basically refreshes  background data whenever it's lost and make it stay active as long as possible until sufficient RAM is available and power is supplied at the end DDR is quite less expensive and only bit less faster than DDR which is why most companies and people around the world widely like and want to power up their electronic devices using DRAM, are you one of them?

  

There are many different types and various sizes of S-RAM and D-RAM based on the RAM type and size you will find number of transistors they're basically containers of RAM which stores data and when it comes to capacitors they work is to store electric power and supply to transistors whenever necessary to let RAM flow work properly including that in RAM you'll get L1, L2 and L3 cache which all are small size while L1 and L2 are widely used on most electronic devices but when it comes to servers we specifically use L3 cache which is bigger than L1 and L2 cache at the end L1, L2, or L3 caches are basically used to store and load most frequently used data on system till some time like for instance if you open a document whichever data it has based on size if it's small it'll get stored in L1 and if it's big it'll get stored in L2 or L3 so that you will be able to access data quickly.

  

You may say why do we need L1, L2, L3 cache when RAM already stores data in background till power supplied though it may does store and load frequently used data like documents, songs, gifs, photos etc but as said earlier L1, L2, L3 caches are small sizes so how they can or what exactly happen if there is heavy resources big software apps and games? see in such scenario most people use L3 cache which is also small size but it doesn't store and load full data of apps instead it store and fetch directories of files so that software apps or games will load faster as system has the preloaded directories cache data so that it can understand and handle them well at the end it's always better to go with good big size RAM more then required so that you can use the system data quickly and smoothly as possible on the go.

  

RAM is important thing as even if you don't have ROM or any other storage still with just RAM you can boot operating system but without RAM device will not going to boot operating system for sure including that if you have less insufficient RAM on Android smartphones it will cause various different issues like quite slow speed and laggyness in system and it can also cause system crashes and bootloops etc which is why it's very important to have big and sufficient RAM for smooth and effective functioning of system units at first back in early era of Android we used to have less RAM size smartphones but eventually as time goes we got advancements and huge demand in market around the world for big RAM Android smartphones thanks to huge demand to supply many companies begin  making and releasing them worldwide due to that now we are now able to multi-task big data system resources effectively.

  

Eventhough, most people usually have and use big RAM size Android smartphones as from past few years most device makers providing big RAM on almost all latest smartphones to attract users and mainly to work as per requirements of current updated and upgraded technologies including that some device makers by default even providing system option to increase virtual RAM by utilizing internal storage super cool technology right? but there is chance you may be using old Android smartphone or even if it's latest one it may have less RAM or may be it does have big RAM but it may be not enough for you etc in such scenarios you either have to buy new big RAM Android smartphone or if you don't want then you can root Android but in order to do that first you have to unlock bootloader which wipe data so kindly backup after that you can install rooting software on Android at the end it voids device warranty unless you are living in European Union inshort EU.

  

There are number of rooting softwares when you install them you will get write access to system partition on Android where you can make right changes to system root files to not only increase RAM but also customize Android extensively at first with root apps like Kingoroot in one click they by using ChainFire SuperSu root software was able to root almost all old Android version based smartphones but it was discontinued back in year 2017 at that time developer TopJohnWu created and released rooting software named Magisk which is systemless and far way better than ChainFire SuperSu made for Android 6.0 marshmallow and above smartphones but thing is you can't install Magisk using rooting apps instead first you have to patch system boot image using Magisk and then use CMD terminal to flash that on Android at the end this process require PC but you can use apps like Bugjaegar.

  

In early era of Android smartphones we used to have less inbuilt storage space smartphones like few megabytes or gigabytes which is why Android used to provide option to move apps to external storage basically SD card on compatible devices but eventually this option was removed by Android as we got big storage smartphones at that time many third party developers build root apps like App2SD,  App Mgr ||| etc to move apps to SD card which work on almost all Android versions but thing is sometimes just moving apps to SD card is not enough right? which is why third party developers created number of softwares and methods to format and use SD card as internal storage for rooted Android smartphones, amazing right?

  

But, in order to use SD card as internal storage first you to format SD card into fat32 or any other type as per developer or you can also make partitions of SD card to make one as internal storage and other as external storage but thing is you need to have top class quality SD card with fast read and write speed so that it can work well as internal storage or else you may face glitches, slow and laggyness while using Android smartphones which is why some people don't want to make SD card as internal storage though it work very well on old Android smartphones but it's not recommended on latest ones though Android even on latest versions of Android providing option to format any SD card as internal storage but they officially do not provide option to use internal storage or SD card as RAM, disappointing isn't it?

  

However, there are some unofficial ways to use SD card as RAM which back in time were widely used by a lot of people on old Android smartphones but again you need to have top class quality SD card with fast read and write speed so that it can work well as internal storage or else you may face glitches, slow and laggyness while using Android smartphones though there are number of unofficial methods to use internal storage as RAM and also as said earlier some makers like Xiaomi on some latest custom Android smartphones even

provide option to use internal storage as RAM but this option is currently limited so you usually won't find this option on stock AOSP based pure Android builds and most custom Android device makers at present don't provide them but don't worry there is chances they'll provide it in near future.

  

In case, you're someone who use AOSP builds or custom roms like LineageOS or CrDroid, Bootleggers etc or OEM builds like ColorOS, FIUI, ROGUI, MYUI etc at present they won't provide option to use internal storage as RAM but still if you somehow unofficially want to use internal storage as RAM then you're at right place there is an proffesional app named Scene to manage and customize Android quite extensively and efficiently by using that you can convert certain amount of internal storage as RAM but it work on Android 10 Q and above versions so very likely require Magisk to work on smartphone if you have it then you're good to go at the end doing 

anything incorrectly can soft or hardbrick Android smartphone which is sometimes irreparable so to not let that happen kindly follow our below provided all step-by-step detailed instructions carefully thus you'll be able to convert internal storage as RAM and use it effectively, so do you like it? are you interested? if yes let's explore more.
