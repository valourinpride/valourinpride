Tecno Pova is a budget premium smartphone series from tecno mobiles with best value for money and powerful features, they upgraded it and released a new version with name Tecno Pova 2, now it's time for Tecno Pova 5G which is already released in nigera back in December how ever it's better late than never now on its way to india on February 8, are you excited?

  

Tecno Pova 5G priced at 129,000 naira in Nigeria which is approximately 23,100 rs in india, so we may expect similar price in india, Tecno Pova 5G runs on Andriod 11 on top of HiOS 8 and sports 6.95 inch HD+ display with resolution of 2460x1080 and refresh rate of 120 hz, based on MediaTek MT6877 dimensity 900 ( 6nm ) octa core chipset with UFS 3.1 : 128 GB of storage and LPDDR5 upto 11GB ram with memory fusion which is confirmed by TECNO mobile india official twitter account.

  

Tecno Pova 5G has three colors dazzle black, polar silver, power blue and it has triple camera which are 50 mp primary sensor, 13 mp secondary sensor and 2 mp tertiary sensor with quad LED flash, while front camera has 16 mp sensor with dual LED flash, In terms of battery it has 6000 mah with18 watt fast charging support for powerful and long standby experience.

  

However, 5G network is not yet launched in India, telecom companies are working on it to bring as fast as they can, but it may take few more years to see complete 5G support in india, while people were not able to get proper 4G in some areas so if don't own any Tecno Mobile like Tecno Pova 1 or 2 and looking for a smartphone to under 25k then you may opt-in for Tecno Pova 5G else existing 4G enabled smartphones works better in india right now until the launch of full 5G services.
