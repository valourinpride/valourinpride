You can merge video files by using apps, softwares and online video merger sites however all of this will consume ram and storage which in return reduce battery so people who don't have powerful phone or pc struggle to merge huge size video files as most video merger platforms take alot of time due to this issue people with low powered devices end up spending hours on video files merger platforms. 

  

However, there is a solution for this by using a social messaging app named telegram where you will get fabulous bots developed by third party bot developers using official telegram public API, on telegram there is a un-official bot named Video Merger Bot which can merge video files in ease but the format of video files should be same including that you can rename your video files.

  

Telegram only allows 2gb size of each file so you can only merge video files which are under or exactly in 2gb size, do check your video file size before sending them to Video Merger Bot, if you have video files on any cloud storage like Google Drive or Mega etc, you can use [Url Uploader X bot](http://t.me/urluploadxbot) on telegram to remotely upload your video files to Telegram easily then forward them to Video Merger Bot to simplify the work.

  

Disclaimer : Video Merger Bot is unofficial bot of telegram, so kindly use at your own risk we are not responsible for personal or financial losses, as telegram won't take responsibility on un-official as there is high data theft risk, if you still want to use Video Merger Bot then begin.
