In 19th century, the era of computers started a advanced hardware machine with GUI aka graphical user interface technology basically a software that can do most physical works electronically if programmed correctly but they're very big and expensive so most people unable to afford and arrange space for them so alot of companies and scientists around the world continuously working to reduce size and price of computers thus it can reach more people for personal interest and to sell them commercially.  

  

Fortunately we got personal computers in 1990s from many companies especially Microsoft and Apple that are small in size and much low price then computers with way more powerful hardware and software that can open world wide web to access and explore internet as well but there are few drawbacks like you can't communicate with people easily that you can do simply on  telephone and mobile phones.

  

Telephone is a revolutionary electronic device first working model is invented and patented by Alexander Graham Bell in year 1876 to transmit voice and communicate with people easily in limited range that completely replaced slow and time taking traditional communication methods like telegraph in which you have to write letters and send them using trained birds and postmans etc so eventually people started using telephones thus alot of companies around the world buyed patent rights to manufacture and sell thier own custom branded telephones.

  

But, The early telephones like computers are big and expensive even though many companies for commercial reasons made advanced small size affordable telephones yet people wanted much more convenient device to communicate and then wireless modern telephones entered in market that are more user-friendly to use in home with high range using cell towers but eventually people got bored of them so to replace we got futuristic mobile phones.

Motorola, a American company made world's first wireless handheld mobile phone in year 1983 named Motorola DynaTAC 8000X that can make long distance calls using cell towers which is way small in size and much better then telephones even though it's expensive but as numerous companies around the world started making thier own custom mobile phones in that process alot of upgrades are added on mobile phones due to that we got modern keypad mobile phones.

  

Most modern keypad mobile phones released from year 2000 are way more small in size and much more capable then telephones and early mobile phones which has it's own graphical user interface - GUI technology a operating system basically a software like PC - personal computer but modern keypad mobile phones also don't have advanced hardware and software like personal computers so you can't do hard tasks and store heavy resources like PC - personal computers on mobile phones.

  

The GUI based operating systems of PCs are super powerful and advanced then modern mobile operating systems so people wanted modern mobiles to have capability of PC thus they can easily do stuff PC on modern mobile phones even though hand-held PDA - personal digital assistants already doing that job.

  

The first PDA is released in year 1989 named Atari Portfolio runs MS DOS operating system since then number of companies made thier own PDAs with different operating systems but the only drawback ot PDAs is you can't make calls and communicate with people without internet while mobile phones can make calls without internet using sim card and cell towers thus people wanted PC level features on modern mobile phones so that they can make calls and also run PC tasks and softwares simultaneously.

  

However, modern mobiles used to have low end hardware and software operating systems like Java and Symbian etc that can run basic softwares and games while PC with powerful hardware and advanced operating system can run heavy softwares and software so PC high performance is definitely not possible on mobile phones.

Thankfully, In year 2007 founder of Apple inc. Steve Jobs launched revolutionary futuristic multi-touch mobile iPhone 1 with powerful hardware and advanced operating system known as iOS that amazed people around the world as it has potential to fully replace keypad mobiles phones but iPhone is costly still people waited in long cues to buy iPhone 1.

  

Apple iPhone 1 is instant successful product just like Apple iMac and iPod so as there is big market for such products companies don't leave opportunity they started making mobiles like iPhone with same or new added features to sell and make profits globally but they can't use Java or Symbian operating system as they're for keypad mobiles and using Apple iOS is also not possible as it's a closed mobile operating system.

While, Google Inc a well known most used popular search engine founded by Larry Page and Sergey brin in year 1998 since then they developed and buyed numerous cool and futuristic products to name a few in february 2003 Google acquired Blogger a content management system from Pyra and then in year 2005 Google acquired Android a mobile operating system from Andy Rubens both are successful now.

Even though, Android acquired in year 2005 yet only in year September, 2008 made it open source and released with HTC Dream since then Android become biggest competitor to iOS as Google smartly made Android a free and open source project aka AOSP any company or individual can use it to build his own custom operating system for thier mobile phones so most companies started making thier own custom Android operating system to install on thier mobiles like HTC and Samsung etc.

The mobiles released after year 2007 with operating systems like Android and iOS are known as smartphones as they have futuristic technologies that are better then keypad mobile phone most people think that the word smartphone entered in the world after 2007 but it's not the term smartphone coined in year 1992 when IBM released Simon personal communicator.

  

Anyhow, Android is free and open source mobile operating system aka Android OS that gone through alot of impovements and developments with updates and upgrades over the years to provide advanced and useful features with security and privacy for its users thus most mobile companies starting installing Android OS on thier smartphones.

  

Smartphones powered by Android OS start at 20$ price even cheaper thus everyone who are unable to afford costly iPhones started buying Android powered smartphones due to that now Android OS has 72% world wide market share dominates iOS which has just 25.58% word wide share yet Google seems like gradually want to replace Android OS on smartphones with it's own Fuchsia OS.

  

Fuchsia is open source operating system mostly written in C++ that support cross platforms you can run it on TVs, cars, embedded devices like traffic lights, smartphones, watches, PCs, smartphones, tablets was first appeared on internet when Google published it's git repository in year 2016 that uses unique Zircon kernel it has different architecture from linux operating systems like Android OS.

  

The name Fuchsia is named after a plant colour Fuchsia it's user interface and software are written in Fiutter a cross development platform which produces apps from Google's own programming language dart that can used to make apps for both Fuchsia and iOS with format .FAR for apps which is equivalent to Android .APK and Fuschia OS uses Escher based Vulcan graphic rendering engine.

  

The entry of Google's new operating system got huge attention from Android users but for whatever reason at start Fuchsia is just demo it was not complete operating system like Android which you can install on Android to test and then in year January 2018 Google published a guide to Install Fuchsia OS on Pixelbooks.

  

On January, 2019 Google added Fuchsia OS into Android eco system and talked about it in Google I / O then after two years in may 2021 Google developers confirmed that Fuchsia OS deployed on Google home devices as a software update then later in year August 2021 it was rolled out to Google nest hub.

  

Anyhow, Google taken 3 years to get it's operating system Fuchsia OS on device just like they did with Android OS but right now there are no Android smartphones that officially pre-loaded with Fuchsia OS even though you can install Fuchsia OS on Android OS so it seems like Google don't want to replace Android OS with Fuchsia OS as it's still in development phase now.

  

It is well known fact Android taken more then a decade to shape up with alot of contributions from developers around the world while Fuchsia OS just got official portal back in 2019 as most developers occupied in development of Android OS very few developers are contributing to Fuchsia OS so it may take more years for Fuchsia OS to reach the level of Android OS till then Google may though not to replace Android OS with Android OS.

  

Even though, Android is most loved operating system on smartphones known for customization but Android mostly use same user interface with few changes  from past Android versions just in Android 12 Google revamped it's user interface yet majority of Android users stuck with old versions as smartphones companies stop updating it's software after 1 or 2 years.

  

There is big problem with Android OS you don't get software upgrades quickly unless you're Google's pixel smarphones user even though Google introduced project treble to update old smartphones without updating softwares using GSI - Generic system image yet most companies not using Treble Project except third party developers from XDA to make custom roms and upgrade old smartphones.

  

In case of Apple iPhone you will get regular software upgrades and updates even on 5 year old smartphones thus many people buy it over Android OS including that there are many drawbacks on Android OS so the release of alternative operating system from Google is much required that fixes the unsolved issues on Android OS.

  

So far, Fuchsia is the only cross platform operating system released by Google after Android OS as they are planning on releasing Fuchsia on almost all devices it feels like Google driving towards to get Fuchsia OS to smartphones as well in future to replace Android OS but we can't say either it will success or not as even the most hyped operating systems failed for instance Microsoft Windows, Firefox OS, Tizen OS, MeeGO OS etc.

  

**[\+ The story of guy who installed Android OS on Windows phone.](https://www.techtracker.in/2022/03/the-story-of-guy-who-installed-android.html)**

  

**[\+ Here's why, Tizen OS failed to beat Android OS on smartphones.](https://www.techtracker.in/2022/04/heres-why-tizen-os-failed-to-beat.html)**

**[\+ Here's why, Firefox OS failed to beat Android OS.](https://www.techtracker.in/2022/03/heres-why-firefox-os-failed-to-beat.html)**

**[\+ Sailfish OS - MeeGo revived to give best alternative to Tizen OS.](https://www.techtracker.in/2022/04/sailfish-os-jolla-revives-meego-and.html)**

  

In fact Google known for successful operating systems either on smartphones or desktops etc so there is high probability that Google may manage Fuchsia OS well to get into market and replace Android OS and compete with other operating systems like iOS but most likely they may not want to loose Android OS as it's a pretty strong project instead they may release Fuchsia OS on devices without replacing Android OS by maintaining it as different project this is very likely to happen for sure. 

  

Even if Google completely abandon Android open source project by stopping upgrades and release a not properly baked Fuchsia OS then third party developers especially from XDA who make custom roms has potential to lead Android unofficially with new features using custom rom clone repositores of AOSP like Lineage OS, Ressurection Remix, AOKP etc.

  

Custom roms from third party developers and mobile companies already have many cool features that are not available on Android open source project like CRdroid, MIUI and HiOS etc so if Google release Fuchsia for smartphones then definitely they have to add way better features that are available on stock and custom roms.

  

Finally, this is what happened to Fuchsia OS let's wait and see will Fuchsia OS replace Android OS in future or not are you an existing user of Fuchsia OS? If yes do say your experience and mention which feature of Fuchsia OS you like most in our comment section below, see ya :)
