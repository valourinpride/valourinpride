Real estate is basically name of industry in which people rent, buy or sell properties like normal or agriculture lands, houses, apartments, villas, mansions etc, since ancient times land properties basically assets always had huge value as they are necessary for people in this world to live conveniently and comfortably back then there is no name for this business in whole but eventually it is named as real estate.

  

When industrial revolution begin in early 18th century at that time people started building various different factories to make commercial products and sell them locally or worldwide but sufficient land is required to setup factories which is why businessmans at quite large scale started buying lands even converted agriculture lands into normal ones due to all of this  real estate slowly begin shaping up as an industry which got recognition globally.

  

Especially, In 19th century industrial revolution rapidly growing around the world at that time many businessmans for personal mainly for commercial purposes  started buying and selling lands, houses, apartments etc in numerous ways to people which increased competition among businessmans due to that real estate business reached new heights though there are ups and downs time to time like any other business but now real estate industry worth more then US$ 7,063 billion worldwide, isn't that amazing?

  

Generally, since ancient times In order to rent, buy or sell lands, houses, apartments etc we exchange properties or pay and take money in form of paper based fiat currency isn't it? but now we are in 21st century modern digital technology era due to that from past last one decade people around the world to buy or sell properties or any other physical or digital stuff using number of cryptos quite extensively which are basically modern digital currencies.

  

Bitcoin is world's first revolutionary decentralized crypto digital currency developed by anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto was released in year 2009 in order to replace centralized banks and fiat currency as they don't provide total control and ownership of your money including that they can't be trusted though majority of centralized banks states that they will protect deposited fiat currency with top industry grade technolgies but at the end they lack transparency so you won't know how they're handling your personal details and fiat currency money which is risky.

  

Especially, it is bit hard to use centralized banks and fiat currency as you have to physically go to banks or it's ATMs to withdraw money but thing is when you want to buy any expensive stuff though you can withdraw large amounts of money still maintaining or carrying and paying big amount of paper based fiat currency is quite difficult for sure which is why large percentage of people now a days using crypto digital currencies as they can be stored and used right from your PCs aka personal computers and smartphones.

  

Anyhow, the main benefits of Bitcoin is as it's digital currency you can store them on hardware or software and custodial wallet softwares which don't require any personal details that provides privacy and whenever you want to send Bitcoin to someone it is authenticated and verified by some people by solving codes of blocks using power of PC or any other electronic device then only transaction will process for doing this they will be rewared with some Bitcoin and then once transaction is successful it will auto recorded on the blockchain explorer due to that you'll get transparency and security.

  

In sense, whatever backend technologies used by Bitcoin is public thus it provides transparency with security which is lacking in fiat currency at first Bitcoin as an asset like a share in stock market used to doesn't have much value as creator want organic growth but eventually it attracted inventors around the world and grown in value rapidly in that process it become top digital crypto currency and over the years  inspired many companies and developers who created their own cool crypto digital currencies which all are now considered as best replacement to fiat currency.

  

There are many well known and popular crypto digital currencies which are now widely used around the world but the thing by using them you can buy anything they not focus on something specific including that if you have a electronic device like PC or smartphones etc then with right eligible hardware and software specifications and technologies you can start mining them to earn crypto currency as rewards which is common but pretty useful for sure.

  

But, what if there is crypto digital currency which is specifically designed and  developed to buy or sell something useful and let you earn them without mining it will be super cool right? there are some crypto digital currencies out of them Remint Network crypto digital currency is one that focuses on real estate market isn't that interesting and amazing?
