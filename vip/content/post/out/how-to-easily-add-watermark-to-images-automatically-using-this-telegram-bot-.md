If you want to add watermark to images, it is little hard task because you need to use apps or software to do the work and it will take alot of time if you have many images and numerous watermark adding apps or software require you to have little skill as most of them don't support adding water mark automatically which mean you have to apply watermark manually for each and every image which can be problematic.

  

So, people who were unable to add thier own watermark on images they are hiring freelancers to do the job or many people working day and night to add watermarks on thier images using water-mark adding apps or softwares which are feature less and most of them are little hard to use for non-technical persons.

  

However, due to latest technologies that we have today like A.I it became to easy, anyone can add thier watermark on the images automatically using A.I artificial intelligence but there is one drawback most websites, apps and softwares have watermark adding facility do not use this A.I technology so users have to do every step manually and repeat them to add watermark to images successfully.

  

Eventhough, most watermark adding apps, websites, softwares do not have & support artificial intelligence which is definitely a drawback but don't worry we have good news there is an alternative to watermark adding apps, websites, softwares, yes you may know telegram is popular social messaging app especially made for people who care about thier privacy and security and if you are user of telegram then you may probably know it is hub of thousands of amazing useful bots.
