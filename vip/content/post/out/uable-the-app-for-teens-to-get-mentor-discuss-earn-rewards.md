The world is filled with talented people so you'll find competition everywhere, the life is like a roller coaster you'll reach ups and downs at certain point of life which makes life more valuable, however some people especially teens due to thier age factor as they didn't seen the life long enough to understand and face the hardships of life, many teenagers struggle to cope up with world or unable to succeed thier startup due to lack of knowledge and mentorship.

  

The fact is experiences teach you more then a book, so it is not necessary to get mentorship if you are capable enough to rise back even when you fell down, but believe it or not getting mentorship from successful people who got success from scratch will give you wider overview on society and change the angle you see the life even prepare you for a better mindset as successful people share very important life or startup lessons that will guide and drive you to become successful or atleast it will strengthen your mind to face life.

  

If you are a teenager and if you believe in mentorship and guidance that will make you a better person, then do remember it is also important to socialize yourself with fellow teenagers or people you feel good, as in socialization you'll get opportunity to discuss, when you start discussions you'll get different views, opinions, tips, guides from numerous people based on thier IQ, so from discussions you can pick the best points and store it in your mind and utilise or apply them whenever necessary in life or startups to move on.  

  

The issue is getting personal mentorship from successful persons is not easy as you need to get appointment which in some cases takes so much time and you may not even get it due to various reasons but do note : it is totally upon individual how you measure successful people as it varies from person to person, for example : I say this entrepreneurs are successful people like : Mukesh Ambani, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos but it may varies to you.

  

it is also important to get mentorship from good experienced people even if they are not successful as you will get ample amount of information, life lessons, and mistakes they done in life which caused them troubles so that you'll become more conscious what to do not to do in your life stages & learn useful stuff as the quote says don't judge a book by it's cover.

  

The another issue that was faced by the teenagers is they were unable to socialize, due to no friends, no good people around surroundings or due to shyness or being introvert, COVID-19 pandemic etc but you need to break certain such barriers like over shyness, introvert this are not good habits, but yeah if you socialize yourself always be polite, use good language and convey and communicate your all questions, opinions, tips, guides in proper manner.

  

However, due to advanced technology in 20th century, today it is not necessary to physical visit successful or experience people to get guidance or personal mentorship as you have social networks like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter to even socialize with unknown people, where you can join in Q/A sessions or do dm's to people whom you think successful etc but don't expect reply as it is not possible for any individual to reply millions of people.

  

In this scenario, if you are interested and willing to get mentorship and socialize yourself then we are glad to announce we have a workaround we found a app named Uable which is dedicated to only teens to ask questions, discuss and join clubs to  have fun, in Uable you can find people from successful companies like Netflix, Amazon and Uable who hold top positions and share valuable tips on thier Uable profile even available for dm's but I'm not sure either they reply or not as they are guest mentors, even if they don't reply with Uable you'll get great opportunity to socialize with alot of teenagers effectively better then other social networks isn't it amazing? 

  

The world, society and some people may always underestimates you & try to drag you down, but Uable and I believe in you just remember you are more than what your grades are, you are more than what your teachers tell you, you are more than what society thinks about you, you are more than what you believe you are So never ever give up, believe in yourself.

  

In Uable, you can find out where your interests lie like design, entrepreneurship, engineering, content, marketing, science, technology, art etc to collaborate and make new friends, build portfolio, ask questions, opinions, do fun challenges and discuss to earn Uable rewards and reddem gadgets & products from U-Store everyday, so are you interested in Uable? do you like it? If yes let's know little more info about Uable before we signup and explore.
