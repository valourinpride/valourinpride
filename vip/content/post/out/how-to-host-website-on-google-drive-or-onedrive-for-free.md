Well, if you want to host website then you have to buy server else you have to host your website on free hosting platforms like blogger but the major issue with free hosting platforms is limitations and restrictions, this is why people like to buy paid servers to keep everything in control, but as we all know custom servers are not free, the price for servers is based on it's features and capacity.

  

So people whoever unable to afford or buy paid servers especially those who are new to blogging choose free hosting platforms like blogger, wix, Google sites etc but as we said earlier once you start using free content management platforms everything will be under thier control, I mean they can delete your website whenever they want if you voilate terms and conditions etc.

  

So people who like to control and own every part of thier website search for some better ways to host thier website, while some geeks like and choose to host thier website on local storage, which is pretty good idea for small sites but if you're website is big then you need to have powerful pc with huge storage to handle resources and make this task possible,

  

However, to host website you don't need free hosting platforms, all you just need is Google drive or One drive account, yes you heard that right! it is possible to host your website on Google drive or One drive with custom domain for free, in this way you can control and manage every part of your website, isn't it amazing? It is for sure so let's know how to achieve this.

  

Before we continue, remember hosting website on Google drive or Microsoft One drive is very easy task, but you will not get any type of tools, plugins or support using this method, which means you can't edit or customize website easily that can be little problematic as you have to do everything on .html file only which require good web development skills, if you don't have it then you can hire someone on fiverr to the job that costs money, now we're good to go.
