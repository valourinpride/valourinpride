Now, we have number of electronic devices which are Integrated with digital softwares out of them most people use and heavily depended around the world are PCs aka personal computers and smartphones which have thier own hardware and operating system basically software programmed to do alot of real life tasks electronically and digitally.

  

There are numerous hardware and mainly operating systems written using several programming languages were utilised by companies on personal computers and smarphones for various purposes for instance Microsoft developed Windows OS which is one of the most popular operating system for personal computers with 76% global market share isn't amazing?

  

Apple inc. also developed it's own operating system for it's personal computers named Mac OS which is popular next to Windows OS but both are closed source thus there is no public transparency of code so you will never know what exactly is hidden in operating system as it's encrypted that can arise privacy and security concerns for sure.

  

Fortunately, Linux Torvalds back in 1990s developed and released an free and open source operating system named Linux written in C and assembly programming languages thus anyone can contributive code for development or use and build  thier own custom version for personal computers or smartphones etc.

  

Even though, the world wide personal computer market share of Linux is less then 3% now yet still as it's public and transparent Linux is preffered by geeks and privacy carers including that Linux is quite flexible which is why most mobile companies use Linux as base to make operating systems for smartphones to name few Android, Tizen, Plasma etc.

  

Google's Android is well known and most popular operating system for smartphones first released in year 2008 for HTC Dream which now has more then 78% world wide market share but it can't install Linux OS apps only .apk format is supported due to restrictions and limitations applied by Google for commercial reasons.

  

KDE plasma is an free and open source well known Linux based operating system for personal computers and smartphones etc used by alot of people who like linux but it can't install Android apps directly for that you have to install and use WayDroid which use Linux name spaces ( user, pid, uts, net, mount, ipc etc to full run Android system in a container and install Android apps on GNU/Linux systems.

  

WayDroid is undoubtedly an amazing tool to run Android apps on linux distributions like Ubuntu but it is quite hard to install and lengthy procedure as well which is why a bejing company named Jing Ling developed and released JingOS for it's world's first ARM processor based 11 inch amoled 2K+ resolution display detachable Track pad keyboard with 4096 LP Stylus tablet named JingPad A1 isn't amazing?

  

Jing OS is an open source linux operating system based on Android open source project with framework of KDE plasma mobile due to that you can not just directly install Android and Linux apps but also get better customization and OEM friendly with security and privacy thus you will get perfectly combined mobile and desktops experience on the go for sure.

  

The development team of JingOS in its forums released Android OS source in 8 archive zipped files on Google Drive with an compilation guide which you can use to build JingOS for your own smartphone but require access to proprietary binary blobs and custom rom development skills then only it's possible but as it's public there is chance that some third party developer already made for few smartphones so make sure to check it on [XDA](http://XDA.com).

  

Anyhow, if you didn't find JingOS custom rom for your smartphone then you can ask or hire freelance custom rom developers to build JingOS for your device or else buy JingPad but seems like JingOS was not in active development which may be one of the reason a developer to revive JingOS developing Hummingbird OS yet still it is definitely worth checking out JingOS so do you like it? are you interested in JingOS? If yes let's explore more.
