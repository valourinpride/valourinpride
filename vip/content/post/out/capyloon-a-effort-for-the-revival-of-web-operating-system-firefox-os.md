Now a days, majority of people around the world feel hard and struggle to survive in this busy modern digital technology era without electronic devices like computers, smartphones which have many operating systems basically softwares build using number of programming languages that has ability to install supported softwares created by developers to do various real life tasks electronically and digitally.

  

Computers are first to execute and run softwares and then comes smartphones which usually have different hardware due to that computer softwares can't directly installed on smartphones and vice versa but each operating system available either on computer or smartphones has it's own speciality in terms of features and options or user interface and functionalities with it's own potential capabilities as well as limitations and restrictions etc.

  

Microsoft's Windows and Apple inc. MacOS are well known and most popular deskop operating system availabile since long time for computers and in case of smartphones they have Google's Android and iOS from Apple inc. itself which are dominant mobile operating systems with huge fanbase and customers and large market share around the world.

  

There are numerous alternatives to top desktop and mobile operating systems as companies and developers for personal or commercial reasons every day develop new or existing operating systems for computers and smartphones out of them only few will get success and remaining get failure and won't sustain for long time due to various reasons and factors.

  

However, we do have some operating systems available on computers and smartphones which despite having less userbase still able to survive in this big competition among commercial softwares out of them most are free and open source operating systems like Linux created by Torvalds and it's distributions like Kali Linux, Ubuntu, Debian etc.

  

Linux has less then 3% global market share now but it was able to spike it up each year thanks to it's long standing userbase who prefer and like Linux over Windows and Mac OS etc including that Linux from past few years expanding to smartphones in form of distros because of user interfaces like KDE Plasma Mobile.

  

Anyhow, many desktops mainly smartphones commercial operating systems failed miserably even being free and open source projects and having innovation from edge to edge due to lack of support out of them to name few Symbian OS, Tizen, MeeOS, Bada OS and Firefox OS etc but they somehow able to get back on track because of third party developers to use or create better operating systems based on them.

  

Firefox OS for Instance is an web operating system developed by leading desktop browser Firefox released in year 2013 on February 21 which came to replace or become best alternative to smartphone operating systems but it didn't instead got defeated in process of tackling existing operating systems like Android and iOS etc.

  

Alcatel One Touch Fire is first smartphone to be launched with Firefox OS released in year 2014 including that Firefox browser launched several new Firefox OS powered smartphones in more then 14 countries but they failed to beat Android OS ans iOS as it not just better but also has strong foundation laid by Google.

  

The speciality of Firefox OS is it's written in HTML5, CSS, JavaScript which are actually programming languages used to develop websites and web apps that's why FireFox is categorised as Web OS and it's software as Web apps which is way different to Android and iOS operating systems as those softwares are written using number of programming languages like Java, C, C++, Rust, Python etc.

  

In sense, when you open softwares on FireFox OS they feel like an website and more like progressive web app which has some advantages like they occupy less space and you won't find much bugs and incompatibility issues in operating system as softwares basically run like on browser but the problem is it's softwares won't feel like regular ones and it's incompatible with alot of softwares as developers don't fully build softwares in HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

  

B2G aka back2gecko is open source project by Mozilla where you find many repositores written for the development of Firefox OS out of them Gaia is one which is an HTML5 user interface for Firefox OS that's innovative which is why there are few percentage of people who strongly like and still prefer to use Firefox OS.

  

But, Firefox OS at the end was big failure like Windows mobile, symbian OS, MeeGo etc due to same reasons out of them the main one is due to lack of support from companies and developers who back then very much focused on developing Android and iOS apps as they have not only better tools but also large userbase globally.  

  

Even though, smartphones with less powerful hardware also support to run FireFox OS without much hassles as it's web OS still most mobile companies didn't used Firefox OS on smartphones instead utilised on demand and better fully stable operating system like Android due to that Firefox didn't got enough scope to not just get futher developement but also become hard to reach more audience.

  

Fortunately, Firefox OS is free and open source via public repositores on GitHub which means anyone can not only commit and contribute code but also use existing code to make thier own operating system or softwares etc due to that now we have few operating systems from several third party developers based on Back2Gecko despite Mozilla already discontinued it.

  

Kai OS is one of the most popular fork that continuing the legacy of Firefox OS which you can see on Reliance JioPhone but it was only available on keypad mobile phones due to that people who use  smartphones and desktops missing out goodness of Web OS provided by Kai OS.

  

Thankfully, recently we got to know about Cappyloon OS which is trying to revive Firefox OS by using and extending Back2gecko availabile for desktops and smartphones but right now it is early stage with no much data regarding it's options and features that will be out in future.

  

Capyloon as per it's development team will reclaim web providing freedom and privacy with it's own web run time including that the current prototype going to explore IPFS protocol which is based on decentralized Web3 for privacy respecting Web Assembly plugins but they didn't said how to they going to Integrate them, so do you like it? are you interested in Capyloon?
