Movies are our part of daily entertainment, people likely depending on movies to relax thier mood and crunch up thier boredom, it is now possible to watch movies from alot of countries in numerous genres based on your taste due to digital technology so it is important to discover movies that you may like and watchlist them to keep in track so that you will able to save time & enjoy.

  

However, it is little hard to discover movies that you like & watchlist them but it is now possible to easily discover, find streaming services and watchlist movies by utilising movie assistant apps which can find, gather and filter movies based on your  preferences and settings like you can search based on genre, rating, country, year, popularity etc even find & gather movies of particular actors or crew.

  

But, the issue with some movie assistant apps was they lack some features which are important and some movie assistant apps are not up to mark that can satisfy which may have bugs or errors with bad user interface & user experience so it is always very important to choose best movie assistant app especially if you recently watching movies so that you won't face issues later.

  

In this scenario, we have a workaround we found a movie assistant app that can find streaming services, discover, manage and watchlist movies with numerous awesome features named AVA - movie assistant which is currently only available on Google Play Store for android but they may launch on App Store for iOS soon.
