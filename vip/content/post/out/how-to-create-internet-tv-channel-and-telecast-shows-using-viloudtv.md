Newspaper used to be the only source available for people around the world to get written information about events that are happening in various fields published by reporters but as newspaper is in written form with black and white or color pictures on paper you must know how to read else you may find hard to understand isn't? In that scenario you have to get help from any one to read Newspaper for you.  

  

Fortunately, we got radio devices by mid 19th century which provide live news provided by reporters in vocal languages so if you don't know how to read written languages on newspaper then Radio will work as best alternative and replacement for that you must have hearing ability to listen Radio channels isn't amazing?

  

Even though, Radio is definitely better then newspapers but it was in vocal form not visual so you can only listen sound plays on Radio streamed by base station not in  video visible format yet still alot of people got used to it but some people who want  to see real life events events in visually for them we got TVs aka televisions.

  

Television like Radio show events by recieving audio and video signals via antenna or cable connected to near base station provided by reporters which is now connected to satelites for flexibility due to that majority of newspaper and radio user base eventually shifted to Television as it's way better than them for sure.

  

If your someone who want to watch channels on regular TV or its evolved version Smart TV then it's completely fine but in case you want to setup your own TV channel then it is lengthy procedure and also quite expensive which is why it's hard to setup unless you have big investments to run TV channels quite smoothly.

  

In sense, it will be struggling to create and run TV channel as several factors involved in process of getting success to name few TRP rating point and advertisments to get money and fuel up new curating content which is never ending procedure to make TV channel stable and stand out in this competitive market that's why most TV channels don't reach top position even sometimes fail and go to bankruptcy.

  

Thankfully, now we are in modern digital technology world with powerful and advanced computers mainly softwares where you can create channels and live stream or upload existing videos and monetize them with advertisments to get money which feel like maintaining real TV but this option is mostly limited to some social networks like YouTube.

  

It is possible to create your own digital web tv without depending on social networks for that you have to know coding to develop your own web tv on website or any other digital platforms so if you don't know that then you can hire freelancers from platforms like Fiverr. to do same job.

  

Recently, we found an platform named Viloud where you can create you own web TV over there you can add number of pre- recorded videos and schedule them as per liking to specific time with your own in between commerical advertisements even live stream using softwares like OBS aka open broadcast software isn't amazing?
