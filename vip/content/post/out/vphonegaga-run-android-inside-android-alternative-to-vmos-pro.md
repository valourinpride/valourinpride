What you'll do? If you want to send and receive calls and messages? or capture real world digitally you most likely use a smartphone to get it done isn't it? which is an evolution of keypad mobile phones and PDAs aka personal digital assistants that was Integrated with many hardware parts and operating system basically softwares developed using number of programming languages that work with different types of charged batteries like lithium-ion ones powered by electrons due to that they are  known as electronic devices by using them you can execute and run almost all real life tasks electronically and digitally.

Especially, smartphones are basically handheld electronic devices so you can use it on the go which can do almost all tasks of PCs in it's own way but usually smartphones cannot handle modern PC level heavy resources softwares due to lack of limited storage and memory but as you may know companies for personal or commercial purposes rapidly progressing in development of smartphones who were upgrading hardware to power up and also advancing software accordingly.

Fortunately, thanks to number of companies now we have flagship smartphones with inbuilt powerful hardware and advanced software which are capable of running heavy resources softwares yet still not totally reached the level of modern PCs as smartphones are usually sealed by default so you can't easily add additional hardware parts like graphic cards or central processing unit etc externally unless you are an skilled technician which is why a lot of people do certain tasks using modern PCs.

However, now a days majority of people use handheld smartphones as most tasks can simply done on them including that as smartphones are pocket friendly you are able to use them more comfortably and conveniently but at the end as smartphone makers on their operating systems restrict access to system level files to protect your device as altering them without knowledge can damage device due to that unless you somehow unlock system level access on smartphone you can't customize operating systems of smartphone extensively.

On PCs in just few keyboard commands and mouse pointer clicks you can run as super administrator to change or edit even even delete or add files on system folders or softwares etc but it is different on smartphones where in order to run as super administrator you have to first unlock bootloader then install custom recovery like TeamWin recovery project to flash rooting software to get system level access that voids device warranty.

There are different hardware and operating systems available for smartphones based on that rooting has to be done properly for instance in order to root Android a popular operating system for smartphones you have to root it using Supersu or it's better version Magisk then you're able to modify or change system level files to get extra functionalities which are not provided by OEMs isn't super cool and amazing?

However, you don't have to root Android powered smarphones to install additional custom software versions of Android but it is not easy as each Android smartphone has different process you have to make or change system files internally for that we have number of development forums with detailed simplified methods for almost all smartphones which you can simply apply on your smartphone to get it done.

But, if you are someone who don't know basic technical terms of Android or neither have interest to know them yet still like to do rooting and install custom softwares carelessly then most likely you may end up messing right software structure of your Android that can surely cause personal or financial data losses as alternating certain Android system files even mistakenly can make smartphone unusable which is why a lot of people don't do such stuff they will instead usually satisfied with locked and stock Android powered smartphones.

In case, the smartphone that your owned is new and under warranty and you don't want to lose it by breaking into locked device system directories yet still want to install another custom Android software, maybe you think it as useful or handy can be used as secondary operating system where you simply store or workout private matters with more anonymity then you can use virtual machine software but to install and run it you need personal computer.

Usually, the majority of virtual machines are available for PCs which are capable of running both desktop and mobile operating systems efficiently but not everyone has PCs isn't it? If you do then it's fine yet still if you may don't want to use PCs virtual software for whatever reasons instead want to use them on smartphones then I like to inform you that there are a number of virtual machine apps available for smartphones as well.

Virtual machine emulate hardware and software of particular electronic device hardware or software in it's code digitally  so that you're able to run certain operating system even if your PC or smartphone etc doesn't have any compatible hardware or software to execute them but making this virtual machines is kinda difficult they are created by third party developers manually without support from official makers that's why they are considered as unofficial and it takes years to make them correctly.

The main reason why most third party developers take so much time to develop virtual machine softwares is due to lack of proper resources which is why almost all  virtual machine developers publish their software code as foss aka free and open source on many contributive development platforms like GitHub where programmers through Internet plus browsers around the world can commit code to improve or even use public code to make thier own custom virtual machines in this process we're not only getting quite better virtual machines softwares but also fast stable ones.

Anyhow, on Android virtual machine softwares are basic where you can though run all desktop operating systems using emulators like Limbo and Exagear etc but they won't work as smoothly on PCs even see lag and glitches most times as even the flagship smartphones are not yet powerful enough to compete with modern PCs but as of now Android virtual machine apps are capable enough to run Android in full scale efficiently and effectively.

There are closed and open source virtual machines available for smartphones and PCs, while in the private virtual machines softwares you won't be able to see certain code that is encrypted by developers due to various reasons like may be they don't want to show up their code and let others use it or they hidden malware or sneeky data trackers into it that will snatch your data without informing you which is why it's better to rignt on go with open source ones where you can check and verify code of software to be in safe zone.

Even though, free and open source virtual machines are definitely always better then closed because they provide transparency that guarantees user privacy and security but right we have very few free and open source virtual machine softwares available for Android like Twoyi and most of them lack many required options and features which are available on closed ones that's why if you want more necessary stuff then may be it's better to go with closed source virtual machine softwares for sure.

Recently, we found an Android virtual machine app which is better then VMOS Pro with numerous amazing options and features named Vphonegaga that currently runs Android 7.1 and Android 10 stable for 32 bit and 64 bit smarphones that even support new Android versions in future including that it comes with in-build root and Magisk support to not just improve but also ultra customize Android so do you like it? are you interested in Vphonegaga, if yes then let's explore more.
