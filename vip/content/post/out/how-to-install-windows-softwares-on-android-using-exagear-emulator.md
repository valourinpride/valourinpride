It is well known fact we can't play PC windows operating system apps on mobile operating systems like Android and iOS as both operating systems has different software and hardware with system limitations but thanks to emulators with them we can bypass limitations of operating systems and experience both softwares vice versa.

  

However, few years back only windows and other desktop operating systems has numerous emulators like BlueStacks to install Android apps and games on PC but now there are few Emulators available for Android as well by using them you can install windows apps and games on Android but don't expect full compatibility.

  

Recently, we found an amazing emulator named ExaGear created and discontinued by Eltechs by installing it on your Android powered smartphone you can enjoy basic windows apps and games for free without PC, eventhough ExaGear is not up to mark of Android emulators available for PC but over the years ExaGear has gone through alot of optimizations to improve windows emulator usage experience.

  

But, ExaGear Emulator is totally dependent on your system capability for instance if you have high powered smartphone then the .exe apps and games you install on Exagear will work better without lags and glitches but incase if you use low powered smartphones then you may face issues.

  

Note : ExaGear is Windows Emulator for Android so kindly don't expect this emulator to run GTA5 and other heavy resources games as you may not even able to fully install them but you can try installing basic Windows softwares that are not big in size and didn't require high CPU and GPU, so do you like it? are you interested in ExaGear? If yes let's know little more info before we explore more.
