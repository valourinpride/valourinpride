Design, design of apple was one of the most influenced and inspired model for many companies mainly for Chinese companies the design feels rich and unique if we considered apple and pixels more likely the fans for apple will be more still its individual preference.

  

Updates Iphone give users software updates for years if you really wanted a phone that can drive for years then owning a iphone is better while android struggles in terms of it unless you own a pixel.

  

iPhone is pricy compared to android and owning a iphone is a stature symbol in india considered by some but iphone doesn't lack anywhere in terms of quality and user experience.

  

If you going for iphone for above then definately iphone is better over android.
