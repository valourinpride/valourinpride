According to experts if you are a beginner it is always better to start filming with the equipment you have already instead of spending on costly equipments without expertise, so utilise the equipment that you have already either it's a smartphone camera or an outdated camera just try to use it to unleash best outcome with the equipment you have and learn from it which will help you in future.   

  

if you only have smartphone then start filming with your smartphone and incase your smartphone is based on Android then there are many camera apps available but most of them are not developed to capture films and cinematic videos like pro so, you either stop making films on Android or you will start looking for alternatives!

  

In this scenario, we have a workaround to let you capture cinematic visuals from an camera app which is developed to make cinematic films on Android it has all the features that are required to make films on Android but you just need to buy the app from play store because it's a paid app there is no free version available!   

  

In search of best camera app that was developed to make films on Android we found one camera app named filmic pro which has ultimate features that you let you capture cinematic shots and films with their features this filmic pro was in development from 2015 so you will get professional camera app with you to capture amazing movies and films on Android and it is #1 camera on android! 

  

Yes, the camera app that was exclusively developed to make films on android it has all features that are required to make films on Android that give you best output to all your videos that you capture in filmic pro with details so you can analyse everything of your capturing videos with its features but these type of features were only there in professional cameras but wait you can get that features in this filmic pro camera app but you have to buy from playstore.

  

It is totally worth to buy this app from play- store it is better to spend little money on filmic pro instead spending alot of money on professional cameras as we said earlier if you are an beginner you should always try to use the equipment that you have according to experts and film makers! 

  

Filmic pro is well optimized to work on all devices but some features may not be ava- lable on your device due to hardware limi- tations so, to get best out of filmic pro it is better to have high end device if you have if not it's fine use your smartphone that you already have with you!

  

just install the app from play store you may not have some features due to your device hardware & software limitations like slow motion, hd resolution, video stabilization and more! 

  

Inshort, filmic pro is a professional camera app to record cinematic video & films with it's all features it can give amazing output if you apply the settings right, however you may need to apply some edits to get more out of your footage with PC softwares like final cut pro or Adobe Premiere pro etc.
