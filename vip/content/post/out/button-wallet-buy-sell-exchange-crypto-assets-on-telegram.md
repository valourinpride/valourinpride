Bitcoin is world's first decentrailised crypto currency created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, even though bitcoin is not popular in the beginnings but eventually Bitcoin become the world's most valued and popular crypto currency in just few years, even today Bitcoin ranks at top then Ethereum and other crypto currencies follows which are probably inspired by Bitcoin.

  

The term crypto currency is widely used only after bitcoin come into existence, now we have millions of decentrailised crypto currencies like bitcoin out there on Internet based on thier own technology, so like we have stock exchanges for stocks, crypto currencies also has thier own centralised crypto exchanges aka CEX from different platforms to buy, sell and exchange crypto currency online.

  

Crypto currencies are digital currency that has it's own market like stock market, but as crypto currency is digital money you can store them in crypto wallets just like you store physical money in bank and use them via digital wallets to send or receive between people, incase of bank once you send or receive money you will surely get transaction details through reciept, while when you send or receive crypto currency you will get transaction details from the network of your crypto currency which records successful transactions for example : blockchain of Bitcoin.  

  

However, Banks don't use any miners to validate and records transactions using technology like blockchain, but majority of crypto currencies utilise and depend on  crypto miners to validate transactions who use hardware power or cloud servers to solve blocks of code to verify and record transactions and thier crypto network like blockchain and yeah crypto miners will get small percentage % of crypto rewards for doing this job.

  

Anyhow, to trade crypto currencies you need crypto exchanges and incase if you want to store, send or receive crypto currency then majority of crypto owners use crypto wallets, we have numerous crypto wallet platforms on internet out there on internet so you have choice.

  

Recently, we found a un-official light and convienient crypto wallet bot named Button wallet created by Alekasndr Safonov to buy, sell, exchange crypto currencies with many features on popular and advanced social messaging platform Telegram which is known for privacy and security developed by pavel durov and Nikolai durov in 2013.
