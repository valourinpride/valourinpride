Pinhole Camera is an hardware device with revolutionary mechanism and technology that will capture real life objects in black and white or colour on print paper or negetive reels known as photographs then after few decades inventors created pinhole camera that can 

capture moving pictures known as films.

  

But, when we got digital camera starting in year 1975 created by Kodak engineer Steven Saason after that many companies created thier own custom version of digital camera with different hardware and software which saves photographs and films in digital formats known as images and videos on hardware storage due to that most people eventually shifted to digital camera from pinhole cameras.

Anyhow, both pinhole and digital cameras according to it's capability create films or you may also call them videos as per movements and creativity of it's director  back then in early 19th century films were 

shown at outside theatres through projectors to audience but people can't always go to theatres which is why companies created film cassettes and DVDs to store films and play them at your convenience comfortably anywhere.

Cassette and DVD players allows you to play almost all cassette and DVDs due to that people around the world eventually shifted to Cassete or DVD players as it can play films efficiently due to Cassettes and  DVDs it become easy for anyone to pre-view and view film on the go which are partly still in continuation in 21st century.

  

Majority of people got used to film casettes and DVDs to play them on TV aka television through supported players due to demand a big market was opened for it with many film casettes and DVDs outlets launched by business mans globally where people can buy or rent thier favourite old or new film cassete or DVDs easily..

The entry of film cassettes and DVDs with home compatible players to big extent positively and negatively effected and impacted film industry simultaneously by mid 19th century people get to see many black and white and color cable network TV channels which mainly broadcast films and serials etc due to that dependence on theatres for films decreased immensely.

Even though, most people limited themselves to watching films via cassettes and DVDs or cable TV channels but alot of people still like to go theatres due to various reasons mainly because of it's big screen and films usually release first day on theatres and then after few months comes to cassettes and DVDs then later on cable TV channels.

  

However, when we got revolutionary PC aka personal computers entered in this world in year 1970s it become best alternative and replacement to cassettes and DVDs players as it with or without cassettes and DVDs can play films that are converted into digital video formats like .mpeg4 aka .mp4 and .matroska aka .mkv etc using video player softwares according to hardware support and compatibility.

Usually, most people don't mind in getting access to piracy prints of films from offline stores if they want to watch it in first day or weeks of its release but some people like and prefer to legally watch films who may have to buy tickets and go theatres or wait until films officially get released on cassettes and DVDs or cable TV channels that takes time based on the film commercial success world wide.

  

In year 1991, Tim Berners Lee created an browser software named WWW aka world wide web that can access public contents of Internet protocol on computers due to that people around the world created and hosted numerous revolutionary digital platforms using various programming languages in format of websites and blogs that expanded the accessibility of films on computers through digital cassette or DVD rips etc isn't amazing and fascinating?.

Fortunately, In year 2005 a revolutionary video streaming website named YouTube released on world wide web of internet that allows anyone to upload and watch video together where companies can publish films but they usually won't do for commercial reasons even if they do it will be after few months or years due to that large percentage of people diverted to piracy websites to watch films as soon as possible.

  

Thankfully, the arrival of OTT digital platforms started in early 20th century which are basically in form of websites or softwares for personal computers and computers created by company with movies and web series that you can select and watch legally without advertisements  after paying for subscription plans or with advertisements watch completely for free. 

  

OTT digital streaming platforms companies self produce or legally acquire copyrights of films or web series etc  

by bidding or direct buying them from producers which is similar to acquiring copyrights of films or web series etc to telecast on Television cable or DTH networks but limited to world wide web of internet that's very useful for sure.

  

Now, we have modern DTH networks evolved version of cable TV networks with alot of features and options where you can mainly subscribe TV channels as many you like in available ones with each one having its own price and watch 24/7 hours but still most people prefer and like to use OTT digital streaming platforms.

  

The main advantage and speciality of OTT digital streaming platforms is over there latest films or you can say movies or cinemas in modern times released in first day or in few weeks or months including that you'll get web series and many more which all you can watch anywhere and anytime on PCs and smartphones.

  

Generally, you won't find most latest films released first day on OTTs mainly big ones but some do which is why OTTs may right now can't replace theatres but in future if producers and companies release thier films first day in OTTs then hopefully one day OTTs will definitely replace theatres that's very like possible in future.

  

Anyway, now a days we have many OTTs as almost all media companies created thier own one seeing the demand and commercial success of other OTT websites and apps but actually a decade have we have very few OTTs due to lack of awareness and no demand from people as they mostly used to focus on TV.

Netflix is widely regarded for uplifting the trend of OTT which is basically movie rental company based in USA who used to sell or rent DVD movies for hours or days and months even they used to deliver them to homes and offices etc who back then understood the potential of internet and smartphones so they created thier own OTT digital streaming platform named Netflix which is now successfull.

When most DVD rental stores in America limited themselves to one or more branches with no much exposure on internet at that time Netflix get on the track of OTT in year 2007 from then Netflix produced and acquired copyrights of more then thousands movies, tv and web series due to that Netflix has $14+ billons of debit but right now it's worth more then $100 billion which is outstanding!.

In sense, Netflix become inspiration and role model for many new OTTs for instance Reliance industries in year 2008 launched Bigflix in india that was not successful but in recent years OTT is quite popular which is why they released new OTT named Jiocinemas which seems like going and working out very well.

  

There are numerous OTTs around the world in india as well which are inspired by Netflix or not but got huge attention and recognition with reception from people thanks to commercial successfull ventures due to that alot of companies striving to create new OTTs to supply demand and crave of people for new exciting entertainment content globally.
