Telegram, a privacy and security focused social messaging platform developed by Pavel durov and Nikolai durov initial release on August 14, 2013 since then with in few years it received millions of users thanks to it's advanced and futuristic features that're  not available on most social messaging platforms including WhatsApp.

  

WhatsApp is well known top messaging platform where you can do unlimited messaging and calls same as telegram but there are some limitations and drawbacks on WhatsApp due to that you can't get full-fledged control on your calls and messages like for instance you can't delete a WhatsApp message once sent after 7 minutes including that there are alot of features missing in WhatsApp that are available on Telegram.

  

Telegram allows you to delete messages whenever you want even after years in addition you can also start a private conversation with someone with self destruct timer where messages will auto expire and leave no traces on Telegram servers including that no one can take screenshots or record your messaging history but In case you don't believe and  trust Telegram then you can use VPNs or add socks and proxies etc to root traffic through secure layer and get much better security and privacy.

  

Most social messaging platforms allows you to create channels to broadcast content and groups to chat with people together but they put members limit like 100 or 1000 members due to that if you have big community then you have to create several channels or groups on one social messaging platform that is bit hard to manage but on Telegram you can create numerous channels and groups and each one can have upto 200,000 members isn't cool and amazing?

  

There are thousands of official and unofficial bots on Telegram of almost all categories developed using Telegram public API which are made using many programming languages and technologies like artifical intelligence to provide alot of useful features which not just manage your telegram account but also simply your real life works in ease.

  

Especially, on Telegram you can upload any file of upto 2GB size which can be extended to 4GB with Telegram Premium that was recently launched on June 10 which can double features and bypass  limitations on a freemium Telegram but generally Telegram Premium subscription is not required by normal users unless you run thousands of big telegram channels and groups and send huge files to users.

  

Meanwhile, WhatsApp being holding #1 social messaging platforms for more then decade with billions of downloads and millions of users per day yet you can only send upto 16MB size file as of now which is one of the main reason people leaving WhatsApp and other low size limit social messaging platforms and getting into Telegram.

  

From past few years, mainly after WhatsApp changed its policies that are not privacy friendly so millons of people left WhatsApp and came to Telegram due to that Telegram has more people to serve which is why Telegram started working even harder to provide new interesting features much faster then before.

  

Even though, Telegram always strive to provide more features regularly yet there are some features missing that are required by certain percentage of users that will be added by Telegram in future upgrade but as of now they are not available so to get them some telegram users using unofficial Telegram forks.

  

Unofficial Telegram forks are build by third party developers using Telegram official API where they may change user interface if required and provide extra features that are not available on official Telegram app which is why alot of people now a days using unofficial Telegram forks over official Telegram app.

  

Recently, we found a telegram fork named exteraGram that has numerous awesome extra features that are neither available on official Telegram app and other unofficial Telegram forks , so do you like it? are you interested in exteraGram a unofficial fork of Telegram ? If yes let's explore more.
