This is internet the one that you're in now created in year 1969 by ARPANET though you're seeing website on your browser app or software but without internet they don't exist and you can't access them but do you know what exactly is internet it is standard protocol to move data on network between computers at first it used to send digital messages between computers and then after that number of inventors upgraded Internet by adapting to latest technologies accordingly to extend functionalities timely in that process we got better Internet to use effectively.

  

However, Internet which is basically network of computers used to be private at that time in year 1991 Tim Berners Lee created world's first revolutionary browser software for PCs aka personal computers which crawl public contents of internet that are in website format basically software developed using several programming languages due to that numerous people around the world gradually using thier computer started creating their own different types of  websites then with computer hardware and memory created server to host on internet isn't super cool and amazing?

  

Now, in 21st century we have millions of websites in web 2.0 for different purposes  but most of them in order to access or use it's digital services ask you to provide electronic mail inshort email address to recieve verification OTP or newsletters messages etc but majority of people use number of websites every day for various purposes so providing their personal email address to receive them eventually full thier inbox totally including that number of websites send spam emails which are not just irrelevant but also not useful that can be problematic, isn't disappointing?.

  

Most e-mail softwares use internet protocols mainly TCP, UDP and HTTP etc to send and receive messages between PCs electronically computers at first they are basic but later on thanks to numerous inventors and companies for personal or commercial reasons over the years done a lot of upgrades to email by adapting to latest technologies due to that right now we have modern powerful and advanced email softwares with number of amazing options and features to use extensively.

  

Even though, there are alot of email service providers where you can setup account in just 1 minute and they even block or provide section and categorize spam emails with delete facility but the problem with them is they require alot of your personal details and telecom mobile numbers including that sometimes they fail to detect spam emails due to that they mix in your primary emails if you didn't care about them for while then they will become hectic after that you have to find each unwanted emails patiently as well as carefully to delete them manually which is quite hard and takes time for sure.

  

Fortunately, we have many softwares with capability to clean and delete spam emails automatically which you can use easily yet still as most email service providers ask personal details due to that some people don't like to use them even if it's from search engine giant Google in order to protect and get full privacy and security for anonymity which is why from past few years alot of companies and developers building open source email service provider softwares to reach more audience worldwide.

  

Meanwhile, many people want to get e-mails from any website or software as they are useful for them even if email service provider categorize them as spam or promotions etc but they don't want to submit their real personal or work email addresses as if they do then they will fill up thier inbox that can be messy at times, don't you think?

  

Once, they submit personal email on unreliable websites or softwares then there is chance that they frequently send you more spam emails or sell your private data to third party companies etc 

including that if they got hacked then your private data will be published online that 

that can cause privacy and security risks which is why most of them like and prefer to depend on temporary emails.  

  

Thankfully, since long time there are numerous temporary email websites and softwares which provide different alias temporary emails where you don't even need to register to use them on any other websites and softwares you like except restricted by default ones then after usage you can delete them instantly but most of them don't provide facility to auto forward received emails to another personal and work email address etc that you may use which is necessary, don't you think?

  

Usually, the main purpose of temporary emails address is to escape from spam emails isn't? but not everyone like to use it in that way there are some percentage of users who want certain emails not directly want to receive in thier email inbox so they instead use temporary email then setup it to auto forward any emails to personal or work email addresses so in this way they whenever required simply delete or stop temporary addresses emails easily.

  

But, most temporary email provider websites and softwares don't have option to automatically forward emails to other email addresses even if they do almost all of them are probably closed source which means thier code is encrypted so you can't see what exactly they stored in it even if there is data trackers or malware and virus etc you may never know them unless you can decrypt them which is why if you care about privacy and security then it's better to use open source ones for anonymity.

  

Generally, you won't find alot of open source temporary email websites and softwares as people don't demand them instead use and throw them away after usage immediately but some do for such users we recently got to know about free and open source temporary email provider app named SimpleLogin is and powerful by Proton AG, ain't you excited?

  

SimpleLogin is open source superhero for anti-spam that act as firewall to protect your privacy and security where you can create, delete, edit, enable and disable unlimited temporary alias email address and let you auto forward received emails to your real one including that you can even self host Simple Login on any Linux server or docker etc isn't amazing?.

  

Note : In case of tempory email provider websites and softwares even SimpleLogin don't work on all online platforms as companies detect and restrict them including that temporary emails without any intimation or warning delete your emailanytime and anywhere so you don't them in valuable and serious matters, so do you like it? are you still interested?
