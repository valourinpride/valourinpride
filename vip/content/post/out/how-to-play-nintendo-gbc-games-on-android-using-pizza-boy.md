Video games, you may probably played them on your TV or home gaming console or atleast heard of them right? back in old days we don't have electronic gadgets like modern personal computers aka PCs and smartphones thus people have no choice other then playing physical games which require extra players but since year 1970s many companies developed and released numerous commercial home video game  consoles by using them you can play cool digital video games on screen in single or multi-player mode using supported video gamepad from home or anywhere you like.

  

We have numerous popular home video game consoles from different companies but most of them discontinued except few companies like Nintendo which still runs home video game console business and become one of the top rated video game company in the world that competes with Sony PlayStation and Microsoft Xbox etc.

  

In 21st century, we're in modern age where majority of old technologies replaced by better and upgraded modern technologies likewise companies done alot of updates and improvements on old video game consoles over the years due to that now we have powerful and advanced modern  home video game consoles like Sony PS5 and Xbox S series that can play super high graphic video games.

  

Even though, we have modern PC and smartphones with millons of HD and UHD graphic games yet people and hardcore gamers buy modern home video game consoles that are expensive but worthy especially when you stream home console video games on social steaming platforms like Twitch and YouTube etc.

  

While, some people buy old discontinued home consoles for nostalgia reasons that are not worthy in this era of modern PCs and smartphones which can do almost any anything in it's own way by using them you can play almost all old home console video using unofficial emulators.

  

One decade back many people and gamers though it's impossible to install and run home console video games on PCs and smartphones but third party developers proved them wrong and made several unofficial emulators to install and play any home console video games on PCs and smartphones like PPSSPP and  Snes9x EX+ emulator etc.

  

Modern PC and smartphones comes with powerful hardware and advanced software still they can't directly install and run home console video games as operating system don't support it due to different hardware and software but unofficial emulators are apps and softwares that are developed to support PC and smartphones which create compatible virtual machine inside them to play video games on PC and smartphones.

  

Home console makers usually don't develop unofficial emulators as it will drop sells of thier existing products thus the unofficial video game emulators that we get on Internet are build by third party developers who don't get any support from home video game console makers due to that third party developers have to work super hard to create and check files that takes time which is why most unofficial emulators stay at early access phase for years even being open source projects on GitHub and GitLab etc.

  

Few years back, modern PCs have more and highly compatible unofficial emulators as it has powerful hardware and advanced software to run video games at desired fps rate but later on companies started releasing modern smartphones that can run almost all tasks of PC in it's own way thus most people and gamers shited to movable and user friendly smartphones due to that demand for un-official video game emulators increased and to full-fill 

this many third party developers created and ported PC home console unofficial video game emulators to smartphones.

  

However, in order to use unofficial emulators legally you have to dump BIOS and games from your own real home

video game console else you have to find and download pirated BIOS and games known as roms from internet to load on un-official emulator that is illegal yet most people prefer to use this method due to lack of real home video game console.

  

Recently, we found an unofficial emulator named Pizza Boy GBC to play Nintendo Game Boy Color videos games aka GBC on smartphones, GBC is popular 8 bit home video game console released in year 1998 as successor of Nintendo GameBoy video game console by world's famous video game company Nintendo.

  

Pizza Boy GBC is one of most stable Nintendo GameBoy color home console video game unofficial emulators that has number of features to run video games in full speed at 60 fps even on old hardware and software smartphones, Isn't amazing ? so do we got your attention? are you interested in Pizza Boy GBA to explore more?
