If you use custom Android softwares like MIUI or HiOS etc and recently upgraded your software to latest version or updated to new monthly security patches then there is a chance that you may be facing issue with some apps especially banking apps which says your Android phone is rooted eventhough you never rooted your Android smartphone.

You don't have to worry about it there is no problem on your Android device, the thing is when you use custom Android roms or softwares some apps think that you are using rooted Android device for whatever reason may be because of custom rom extra features, anyhow you can easily fix this issue for free.

\- Bingo, now you can use that app without any issues like your phone is rooted.

  

Atlast, this are just highlighted features of Island there may be many hidden features in-build that provides you external benefits to give the ultimate usage experience, so if you want one of the best app to fix apps that says rooted on non-rooted Android device then Island is worthy choice.

  

Overall, Island comes with dark mode by default but I expected more modes, anyway it has clean and simple interface  that ensures user friendly experience, but in any project there is always space for improvement so let's wait and see will Island get any major UI changes in future to make it even more better, as of now Island is super cool.

  

Moreover, it is definitely worth to mention this is the only method available on Android to fix apps which says rooted on non-rooted smartphones using Island app, and remember this method won't work on rooted Android devices where you must have to use Magisk Hide, DenyList, Shamiko etc to hide root and run apps.
