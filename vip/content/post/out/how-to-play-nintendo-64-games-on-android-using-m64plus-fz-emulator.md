Digital games, you probably know them as in 21th century we have millions of them on home gaming consoles, smartphones, PCs etc which we can play anywhere and anytime from home or any place you like and mainly digital games don't need extra players thanks to auto bot mode so people around the world shifted to digital games from physical games because of busy life style in this modern tech world.

  

Most people now a days playing digital games on smartphones over PC and home gaming consoles as smartphones are user friendly and easily movable yet they are many people who still like to play PC and home console video games out of them some people want to run PC and home console video games on smartphones which is not possible a decade back because of different hardware and software limitations.

  

Even now it's not possible to directly Install and run PC and home console video games on smartphones but from past few years we got number of PC and video game emulators unofficial emulators from talented developers around the globe to install and run almost all home console video games on smartphones.

  

PC and home console video game unofficial emulators that we have on smartphones are created by third party developers as PC and home video game console makers usually don't like to create official emulators as it will decrease sells of thier existing products thus third party developers don't get any support due to that they have to do heavy research to make and check files to develop PC or video game emulators on smartphones that is tough and takes alot of time that's why unofficial emulators stay at early or beta phase for yeara even being an open source projects on GitHub or GitLab etc.

  

There are two ways to use unofficial emulators, legal and illegal when it comes to legal method you have to dump BIOS and games from your own real home video game console on unofficial emulators while in case of illegal method you have to first download pirated version of video game from Internet that are uploaded without permission from home video game console makers to load on your unofficial emulators.

  

Even though, PC have more unofficial video game emulators then smartphones as PC has better powerful hardware and advanced software then smartphones but from past few years mobile companies started manufacturing and releasing modern smartphones that are comparable to PC thus developers who already created unofficial video game emulators for PC or want to create one due to high demand building and porting them to smartphones.

  

Now, we have number of  unofficial video game emulators to play video game of almost all home console video games on smartphones to name Sony PlayStation series, Sega, ColecoVision, Bandai especially you can play all old and new Nintendo home console video games on smartphones using unofficial emulators.

  

Nintendo, a popular video game from Japan released it's first home video game console " NES - Nintendo Entertainment System " in year 1983 since then they developed number of different and upgraded home video game console products that are better then existing ones even Nintendo done alot of innovations on home video game consoles like world's first 3D simulator thus Nintendo got super success and become people's favorite home gaming console.

  

Now a days, we have unofficial emulators to play latest Nintendo home console video games on smartphones yet some people want to play old Nintendo home console video games for Nostalgia reasons thankfully there are numerous unofficial emulators to fullfill requirement and recently we found an unofficial emulator to play Nintendo 64 home console video games on smartphones using M64Plus FZ Emulator.
