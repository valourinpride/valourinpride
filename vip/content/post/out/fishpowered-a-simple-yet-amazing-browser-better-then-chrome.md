WWW - world wide web is an browser  software developed and released by Tim Berners Lee in year 1991 for computers that allows you to view public contents of internet that are in form of websites and blogs which are like softwares developed using number of programming languages at first in web 1.0 era they are mainly build  using HTML and CSS but from web 2.0 era started in early 20th century people begin using advanced programming languages to develop modern websites which all can execute tasks electronically and digitally.

  

Now, we are upgrading to decentralized internet known as web 3.0 which is way better with top notch security and privacy for instance crypto currency but already in web 2.0 itself there are many powerful and advanced websites so to handle them alot of developers and companies build many  modern browsers accordingly which are equipped with many options and features thus you people can browse world wide web conveniently and comfortably.

  

There are number of modern browsers which are in wide usage out of them Google's chrome and Mozilla Firefox are most popular around the world available for cross platforms like PCs aka personal computers and smartphones etc which are quite awesome but lacks many features and options that are required by large percentage of users due to that they not just unable to adapt and work in full scale but also in-capable to satisfy every one.

  

Even though, we have numerous alternatives to Chrome and Mozilla which are way better then them like for instance Via is tiny KB aka kilobyte sized browser integrated with alot of amazing and useful features and options to name User-agent, resource sniffer and view source etc with  clean and blazing speed browsing that has tagline less is more so if you like it then it's definitely worth checking out for sure.

  

However, Via also lack certain required options and features which are provided by some other browsers but there are big in size that use more storage and memory including that some browsers are bloated with too many options and features which are no doubt cool and fantastic but being having so much stuff on browsers surely may distract you which can spoil simple and user friendly browsing on the go.

  

If you're someone who want as many options and features on browser then it's fine but alot of people don't who instead require certain extra features and options that are unavailable on popular browsers like Chrome and Mozilla without negetively impacting speed and user friendliness of browsing for regular usage such browsers 

are usually limited in few numbers yet can most likely impress you for sure.  

  

Soul named browser is one which is way better then Chrome and Firefox including that it has many features and options that are not even available on Via like to name few in-build DNS, screenshot, photo editor, one hand mode etc but it lacks one of the very important feature which is growing in demand and available already on YouTube known as PiP or window mode for regular browsing so to get that you may have to rely and depend on external softwares.

  

Recently, we found an browser named fishpowered available for smarphones which not just way better then Chrome and Firefox but also Via and Soul not in terms of options and features but in user friendly browsing and multitasking simultaneously with required options and features which is what we wanted isn't? so do you like it? are you interested in fishpowered browser ? If yes let's explore more.
