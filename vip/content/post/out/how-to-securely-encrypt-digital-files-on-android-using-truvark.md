A century back in this world most people used to store thier valuable things in safe and secure secret places that no one can access like treasures in islands or forests and homes or bunkers even in sea by few smart people at the same time they used to store money in government and private  banks as well which provide most secure vaults designed by experts including that  they also have many qualified employees and professionals to manage them.

  

Now a days, in this modern digital era majority of people around the world have thier valuable things as digital format files created via PCs aka personal computers and smartphones like photographs as images and films as videos which they usually save and store them on physical or cloud digital hard or static drives to keep them secure and protect thier privacy.

  

But, most people in order to safeguard thier digital files available on hard or static drive disks encrypt and lock personal computers which is not right way as they can easily pull out hard and static drives and then add on other personal computer or smartphones to view them comfortably which is why it's always better to encrypt and lock hard or static drives with strong password thus no can access your digital files other then you isn't awesome?

  

Meanwhile, from past few decades alot of people storing thier digital files on cloud storage platforms available as software or digital website on WWW - world wide web accessible on browsers which in backend use various physical hard or static drive with different storage capacities that they provide in digital format where you have to simply signup with email or phone number and password then start uploading all your digital files on the go conveniently.

  

However, there are few drawbacks and problems with cloud storage platforms like for instance most of them use centralized servers which are situated in one country of world where people store digital files but they are primarily targeted by black hat hackers who can exploit and gain access to your digital files anonymously to delete or publish them online illegally which may get you personal or financial losses so if you want full scale ownership then cloud storage platforms may not work for you.

  

Even though, physical hard or static drive disks are best alternative to cloud storage platforms but they have some drawbacks like foremost they are expensive so not every one can afford them even if you do they have quite limited storage capacity available in big and small sizes yet still it's difficult to manage them if you somehow lose it then all your digital files will be lost with no way to recover them again.

  

Anyhow, if you still decided to use hard or static drive disks then you have to encrypt and lock them with password to not let anyone open them for that purpose we have numerous softwares available for personal computers and smartphones but most of them are closed source so you can't trust and rely on them totally.

  

Recently, we found an partly free and open source modern vault file encryption app for smartphones named Truvark that will be fully free and open source soon which don't have Internet access and user facing permissions including that it don't include ads or telemetry and does not run an un- encrypted cache for thumbnails for full fledged complete security and privacy.

  

Truvark allows you to create multiple vaults and folders with inside folders on one device which currently encrypt images, videos, audios and modatabases including that many more features and options upcoming like move files and folders to different folders, rename folders and vault etc with future plans like support for more file types like text and pdf etc and desktop clients for more awesomeness.

  

The main speciality of Truvark is it uses Tink a component library build by Google engineers for Google Pay which provide easy to use multi-language cryptographic APIs, including that it also uses Argon2(id) for key derivation which back in year 2015 won password hashing competition which all are free and open source on GitHub.

  

Generally, most smartphone vault apps  don't encrypt database they just hide but here on Truvark it encrypt database using open source Realm database including that it also supports fingerprint biometric authentication to unlock vault that require Android keystore which not all devices support even if they have fingerprint so keep that in mind and don't need worry if your smartphone don't support it.

  

Usually, you have to provide Internet access permission on most vault apps available for personal computers and smartphones for cloud synchronisation and data tracking purposes etc but on Truvark it's not available which is fully offline app but developer provided an option for logging that you can enable to manually send feedback and bug reports to help in development of Truvark.

  

Note : Truvark is still in early access phase which means development is in progress so you may find bugs or limited number of features but eventually Truvark may fix all issues and release more interesting and exciting features in future, so do we got your attention? are you interested in Truvark? if yes let's explore more.
