There are numerous era's in this world of wonders and now we are in modern era where electronics and digital technology gadgets control and connect people around the world by using them you can simplify hard tasks even reduce physical activities as much as possible like for example : few centuries back we used to play outdoor games but now we have powerful and advanced devices like home gaming consoles, personal computers and smartphones through them we can play amazing digital games on screen at your comfortable spaces.

  

Even though, personal computers aka PCs and smartphones has millons of digital games yet many people and retro gamers¬† still like and want to play home console video games but they are bit expensive especially Sony PlayStation series even if someone can buy latest home video game consoles still they prefer and like to play home console video games on modern and user-friendly PCs and smartphones.

  

One decade back it's not possible to play home console video games on PC and smartphone due to different software and hardware with system limitations but later on many third party developers created¬† plethora of cool and amazing unofficial emulators to play any home console video games on PC and smartphones.

  

But, In order to play home console video games you have to download and use specific unofficial emulators each and every time as usually majority of unofficial emulators only support and allow you to play one or two home consoles video games for ex : PPSSPP emulator from Henrik Rydgard only play Sony PSP video games even though there are all in one video game emulators like Lemuroid still they lack few home console video games.

  

If you're someone who play home console video games on smartphones or PCs then you probably know you have to open each unofficial emulator 1 by 1 several times a day to access your favourite video games right? It's boring so have you ever thought to put all your home console video games in one place and manage them whenever required? It's actually possible using front end emulator video games launchers.

  

Emulator front end are not real Emulator they are just platforms which provide option to add all your home console video games and then you have to set desired emulator for that video games once you setup basic requirements you can tap on your favourite video games from Library then emulator front end will launch that video game directly on your real emulator.

  

Fortunately, We have numerous emulator front ends for desktop and smartphone but the one that really amazed me was Daijish≈ç a open source emulator front end that has numerous features to manage your home console video games and it is just 9 MB in size while other emulator front-end platforms are more then 100 MB in size like Launchbox and RetroArch etc.

  

Daijish≈ç is still in early access phase which means development is in progress so you may find bugs or limited number of features but eventually Daijish≈ç may fix all issues and release more interesting and exciting features in future, so do we got your attention? are you ready to explore more? If yes let's get started.
