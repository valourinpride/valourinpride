Telegram, a popular privacy and security focused social messaging app created by pavel durov and nikoai durov back in year 2013 from then as always Telegram providing numerous advanced and futuristic features regularly for creators and people around the world to give best and safe usage experience.

  

But, few years back telegram used to show high negligence on removing piracy content on it's platform even after getting number of DMCA complaints that's why Telegram is frequently get blocked by DMCA and banned in many countries but somehow after few months or years Telegram managed to escape from law enforcements and DMCA restrictions.

  

However, Telegram over the years gained millions of users in numerous countries thus right now they can't afford loosing users if get blocked or banned again which is why Telegram like any other social messaging platform started answering DMCA complaints and removing those piracy content channels, group and bots  within few days in most cases.

  

Eventhough, Telegram is serious on piracy channels and groups still they were unable to make piracy free social messaging app as telegram users using different methods and tricks to reduce DMCA notices for example : pirates on telegram smartly utilsing bots, private channels or groups and cloud unlimited video hosting sites like Mdisk and Streaam to publish or distribute piracy content.

  

Recently, Telegram in latest update released restrict saving content option for telegram public and private channels by enabling that no Telegram user can copy forward, or save content of Telegram channel which is definitely beneficial for creators as it will reduce unauthorised copying or distribution of copyrighted content but this feature is also been used by pirates on private channels to reduce or escape from DMCA complaints.

  

If you're an existing user of telegram then you may probably know in order to join private channels of telegram you need private invite link without that it's impossible to join private telegram channels as they're not public so DMCA won't be able to check for piracy content unless someone forward and report copyright infringement content on private telegram channels.

  

Here's, where pirates enabling telegram restrict saving content feature on thier private channel thus no one can can forward copyright infringing file to report DMCA, but this method is also stopping normal and general telegram users from saving and fowarding files to people they like and public link generator bots which is not cool right?

  

Anyhow, Telegram is well known for super useful and amazing unofficial bots by using them you can do almost anything on telegram created by third party developers using telegram public API and today we found a bot named @Save\_Restrict\_bot by using that you can forward and save content of restricted telegram public or private channels, so do you like it? are you interested in this bot? If yes let's know little more info before we explore more.

  

Note : this method and process given below is completely and totally legal because here the official API provided by the platform itself was ethically used by some third party developers to get desired features and options with unofficial bot so if there is any issue araised regarding this then effected persons kindly may contact owner and host of this bot to resolve any matters, I just shown this bot working process purely for demonstration and information purposes, hope you mind it.
