VR aka virtual reality and AR aka augmented reality are two revolutionary technologies which though has long history starting from year 1960s but only from last one decade VR and AR got huge spotlight as now in 20th century we have many modern technologies and electronic devices like PCs and smartphones to right on support VR and AR which is why many developers and companies over the years constantly updating and upgrading VR and AR to improve and extend it's capabilities so that we can use them extensively.

  

Majority of people already know about VR and AR as many companies widely using them in almost all sectors and fields on their products or softwares etc but incase if you don't know about them then for you in simple at first VR is basically digtal graphics which can be of anything from real life obects to imaginery ones like theatre or totally new world created using softwares which you can experience like real using VR headsets on the go.

  

When it comes to AR it's different from VR where virtual graphic objects get life in reality not the one which we see with eyes but through camera lens in connection with softwares like for Instance you can put graphical dinosaur in reality visible to your camera using certain softwares of PC aka personal computer or smartphone but in order to view them you need to have few compatible sensors like Gyroscope if you do then it's better to have AR headsets to experience them vividly for sure.

  

In sense, VR and AR headsets if used for VR and AR content then you'll get real life experience it will feel like you're present at that VR or AR world provided by software of PC or smartphone that's why many people mainly gamers like to use VR and AR headsets but thing is you can view VR and AR content without headsets as well though there will be noticeable difference as you are not using lens instead directly viewing the VR and AR content on display sceen of PCs or smartphones etc.

  

There are many developers and companies who created various different concept VR and AR based softwares out of them metaverse is one in which there will be a specific size digital virtual space that can be anything like a blank land with various shapes or universe full-filled with many planets which you can own or sell for free or by paying fiat or crypto currency after that you can add your own stuff like digital gifts or online stores etc according to supported resources, isn't that cool?

  

Usually, most metaverse platforms are VR based ones with many virtual spaces and objects but now a days thanks to number of futuristic developers and companies who are making pretty innovative AR metaverse platforms which can amaze you though you can directly view them on display screen of PCs or smartphones but to get more appealing look with real like  feel it's always better to experience them with VR or AR headsets, don't you think?

  

In AR metaverse platforms people usually  capture and publish real places of world  in 360° angle in which they can add virtual graphic obects so that you can check them while exploring that place remotely from your PCs or smartphones same as VR metaverse but AR one is way better than VR metaverse as in AR you will be close to reality to name one best example the of AR metaverse is well known and most popular game is Pokemon Go.
