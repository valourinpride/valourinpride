We can unlock limitations of android by rooting which enables you to access top level system files which you can edit or modify according to your requirements.

  

Once you root your android device then you can tweak alot of things like increasing your phone performance, gaming experience and expands battery life etc.Â 

  

**But**, this tweaks can't be done easily you need to have alot of knowledge about android to modify system files to get your desired result if you done anything wrong then it may lead to serious issues like your device may even hardbrick and endup in bootloop as well.

  

**Note** : Rooting your device voids warranty. instead of doing manually do use tweaking apps made by pro developers available to public through dev's portals like [XDA.com](http://XDA.com) or [4pda.ru](http://4pda.ru).

  

A developer named **Danijel Markov ( DAN )** with **XDA** profile name **paget96** from serbia developed an app named L Speed which have collection of tweaks to increase phone performance, reduce significant lags also extends battery life with aÂ  lot more tweaks to get best most of your device.

  

L Speed is the only app to provide all the tweaks included into single app with clean user interface for simple user experience.

  

L Speed previously available in playstore but later removed by playstore the reason is still unknown probably due to playstore policy violation due to that currently you can only get L Speed from XDA or paget 96 projects telegram channel etc.

  

L Speed is also available as module if you are not willing to install app then you can search for L Speed module in magisk manager to download and Install it, once you done then reboot your phone you'll now ready to enable alot of tweaks from L Speed manager installed in your phone.

  

One of the interesting feature of L Speed must be highlighted L Speed have a UI optimisation tweak which can increase YouTube video resolution up to 4k which doesn't require high end device and works with low end device to but if you are facing issue then reduce resolution to solve this.

  

**However**, it is mandatory to root your device else none of the tweaks work make sure you rooted your device and granted root access to L Speed for flawless experience.
