Java is most successful mobile operating system for keypad phones developed by sun microsystems in 1999 even though Java is created for different purpose yet it eventually become world's popular and most used programming language to develop software for mobiles and PC.

  

Now java is owned by Oracle, anyway Nokia created a operating system named Symbian but it failed to beat Java as most companies like Google and people already got used to user friendly java development kit and easy to understand code to create apps and softwares etc.

  

However, when Apple launched iPhone smartphones with iOS operating system in 2007 people switched to iPhone from Java powered keypad phones and within a year in 2008 search engine Google launched smartphones with linux based operating system named Android.

  

Android is open source software due to that smartphones powered by Android are available for 1/10 price of iPhone thus most people started switching to Android leaving Java and other operating system behind, right now Java which once dominated keypad phones has very few users as even companies who make keypad phones using Kai OS.

  

But, Java is still used to develop apps for Android even though Google said to use Flutter which is best to develop modern apps, anyhow if you're someone who got used to Java phones then very likely you enjoyed playing Java games and running java apps right? If yes have you ever thought to experience them again?

  

Fortunately, we have many developers who created app version of few java games for Android on Google Play but they won't give you full fledged java experience so people whoever not satisfied with them can use J2ME emulator a open source app to play Java games on Android for free.
