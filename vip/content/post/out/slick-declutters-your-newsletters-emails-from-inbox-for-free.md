Do you frequently subscribe to newsletters from your favourite website or blog? If yes then you most likely using email platforms like Gmail, Yahoo, Overlook etc isn't? if yes then you probably know this popular email platforms don't categorise the newsletters in your email inbox which looks messy and bit hard to search and read newsletters.

  

Usually, regular email platforms get 1000's of newsletters from marketing companies without your permission and authorisation which you generally ignore, however when the number of newsletters from marketing companies increases beyond your patient level then irritation begins.

  

Marketing emails mix with your favourite newsletters in email inbox thus sometimes you may not catch up reading newsletters, so to fix this problem we recently found a app named Slick which declutters all your newsletters from email inbox, where you can organise and categorise newsletters as you like, isn't this cool and useful? 

  

Slick is still in early access phase which means development is in progress so you may find bugs or limited number of features but eventually Slick may fix all issues and release more interesting and exciting features in future, so do we got your attention? are you interested in Slick? If yes let's know little more info before we explore more.
