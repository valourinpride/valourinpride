Most people on internet very concerned about thier online security and privacy & many companies introduced secure and privacy protecting terms and conditions but to get more security and anonymity people started using secured & privacy based VPNs to protect & safeguard thier personal data but they are not at all enough for Millenials out there, so people starting using open source apps and softwares for more security and privacy.

  

The most important app or software that needs to be secure is browser we have numerous browsers availabe out there on internet which most of them says and claims to protect user data and protect and provide privacy and security to user but the issue is most browsers apps or softwares are closed source which means normal public can't view it's code so there will be doubts arising about true security and privacy of your personal data.

  

Eventhough, we got very strict laws on protection of users data but still there are crimes everyday can be seen in news on data scandals and private data stoled by hackers etc so there is huge chance your personal data provided to a genuine app that you feels may someday gets into hackers or vulnerable persons, so as safety concerns it is better to take care of your personal data from now itself from every way possible as it is in your own hands to protect and secure your personal data available on your devices.

  

So, foremost as priority most people use browser alot and it is the most used app and software around the world due to that it is more vulnerable to hacking so choose a browser from renowned popular company that has best terms & conditions to protect & secure your data and it is always better & best to chooose open source browser as you can see the code you can have more assurity that makes you rely upon it.

  

In this scenario, we have a workaround we found an open source secure, eco friendly, privacy respecting browser named monocles especially made for people who care about thier security and privacy as it is equipped with alot of privacy & security based features, monocles not bloated with ads and unnecessary features so that you will get pure browsing experience but the only issue is monocles currently only for Android which is little drawback but monocles browser may soon available for iOS in future, do we got your attention?
