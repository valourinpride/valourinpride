Camera is a revolutionary technology that has more then century history invented by 

Frenchman Joseph Nicéphore Niépce in year 1816 which allow you to take B&W aka black and white photo of anything in real life at first Camera is basic but later on inventors around the world upgraded Camera to improve quality and resolution of photo in that process in year 1861 Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell produced first color photo using RGB aka Red, Green, Black colours but only in year 1861 Thomas Sutton taken first colour photo using RGB method since then the era of colour photographs begin globally.

  

Most people got used to B&W and color photos using big camera for decades and then in year 1888 on october 24 Louis Le Prince a French inventor recorded world's first 1 minute black and white short silent film named Roundhay Garden Scene since then many black and white silent films are recorded with increased time length then in year 1902 inventor Edward Raymond  Turner made world's first silent colour motion picture film.

  

However, films without sound is like bulb without electricity so people were unable to enjoy silent films to full extent many inventors worked to develop sound included films and then in year 1927 world's first black and white sound film premiered named The Jazz Singer with synchronised speech, some music and sound effects that put an end to silient films and amazed everyone.

  

Even though, Black and white sound films are welcoming yet as they don't have real life colour people are not full happy but in year 1928 first colour film with soundtrack released named The Viking since then many inventors developed films with sounds using different technologies due to that by year 1939 we got well made full synchronised colour sound films.

  

But, back in early 19th century you have to buy big and expensive camera to take photos thus only film production companies used to own them yet eventually by mid of 19th century individuals also started buying cameras for various purposes especially to setup photo studios meanwhile many inventors and companies keep on working to decrease the size and price of camera with increased features to reach everyone for commercial reasons.

  

Thankfully, Camera gone through alot of upgrades and modifications with advanced technologies due to that in year 1975 Eastman Kodak created world's first digital camera that will display photos on it's screen since then camera companies around the world started making digital cameras as most people are interested in buying them over traditional cameras.

  

Digital camera at first are little big and costly but later on the size and price decreased immensely with new added advanced features to take ultimate photos and films aka videos in modern terms as films are displayed on screen anyway at first most people and companies used digital cameras to take photos and record videos to make movies but later on digital cameras turned as CCTV closed circuit surveillance security video cameras.

  

Léon Theremin a russian scientist invented a wirless system by using that he connected a camera and television in year 1927 during Stalin times to see visitors coming to Kremlin in mosow which is known as first surveillance camera but it was very basic and not comparable to  modern CCTV surveillance security video camera systems.

  

In 20th century modern surveillance security camera systems are equipped with advanced features and technologies which are powerful yet so small that you can't find with your eyes thus they are used for extreme surveillance in various places like homes, offices, outdoor public places and military operations for safety of valuable assets and people or to gather evidence by law enforcement agencies.

  

There are two types of CCTV surveillance camera wired and wireless in wired you have to first fix CCTV surveillance camera at desired locations then manually connect it's cable to TV or PC aka personal computer to watch and monitor in real time but in order to do that you have stay in one place that's inconvenient for sure.

  

While, on wireless CCTV surveillance camera you won't get any cable as they use IP so instead you have connect and pair to television or PC using bluetooth or WiFI etc then you can remotely watch and monitor in real time from anywhere in the world using any PC or smartphone.

  

Now a days, majority of people using wireless surveillance security cameras as they are easy to setup and comfortable to remotely watch and monitor various places they like in real time on PC or smartphone using wireless CCTV surveillance security camera remote real time monitoring softwares and apps etc.

  

PC is like 14 to 24 inch big due to that you can't move and hold in your hands to use instantly thus you may not able to monitor wireless CCTV security camera footage quickly so most people in this modern digital technology era using smartphones to watch and monitor wireless CCTV security surveillance cameras in real time.

  

Recently, we found one of the best wireless CCTV security surveillance cameras real time remote monitoring app named AI View that has all required features by using that you can watch and record live footage of CCTV security surveillance camera on smartphones so do you like it? are you interested in AI View? If yes let's explore more.
