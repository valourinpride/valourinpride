When it comes to crypto currencies, most people choose and prefer bitcoin as they consider it's safe to invest in bitcoin over others due to it's value and exponential growth over the years, but for Elon Musk Dogecoin is better then Bitcoin due to it's fast and low fees transactions, Elon Musk is himself a successful entrepreneur who founded popular and futuristic companies like Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, Paypal etc.

  

Elon musk on his twitter handle and on personal interviews frequently promote his favourite Dogecoin, when ever he tweet or spoke about Dogecoin, the prices of those coin will spike for some period of time and grasp world wide attention this is why new crypto coins try to get attention from Elon Musk to succeed, over the years only few meme coins like Dogecoin, Shib inu, Baby doge coin got promoted by Elon Musk.

  

Elon musk like crypto currencies, so from the start he believes that crypto currency is future of payments, this is why Elon Musk promote crypto currencies where ever necessary and required, his popular company Tesla started accepting crypto currencies like bitcoin as payment to buy electric cars, however you won't be able to buy Tesla cars using Dogecoin but now you can buy Tesla's merchandise using Dogecoin on official website.

Here's why, Elon musk in the process of promoting Dogecoin, on Dec 14 2021 on his twitter handle tweeted Tesla will make some merch buyable with Doge and see how it goes, Tesla as said made limited edition merchandise named Tesla cyber whistle and now Tesla accepts Dogecoin as payment to buy it's cyber whistle which costs 300 Dogecoins and already got out of stock, seems like Dogecoin worked out.

Cyberwhistle is a limited edition premium collectable made fromÂ  medical grade stainless with a polished finish inspired from CyberTruck, Elon musk says Don't waste your money on that silly Apple Cloth, buy our whistle instead!, which is one of reason Cyberwhistle got out of stock in few minutes.

  

What's next? Out of stock, is a good sign for future, even though many people were unable to buy Cybertruck but if Tesla and Elon Musk feel Dogecoin as payment method worked out then Tesla may in future also accepts Dogecoin as payment to buy Tesla electric cars, it is possible unless US government laws & regulations on crypto currencies change over the time.

  

However, here the question arises why only dogecoin and not Shiba inu or Baby dogecoin which are also promoted by Elon Musk, that's a valid point but according to Elon Musk Dogecoin is more efficient and effective interms of transactions so may be that could be the reason or Elon Musk first favorite crypto coin is Dogecoin so he may preferred it over others.

  

But, I think Dogecoin as payment method is stepping stone of adding more crypto coins as payment method to buy Tesla products in near future and yeah for sure there is no guarantee and it takes alot of time, so let's hope for the best, but always remember buying and investing on crypto coins are subjected to market risks.

  

Finally, Today on Dec 14 2021 Dogecoin investors and holders are more happy then they ever before as from now Tesla accepts Dogecoin as payment to buy merchandise which not only increase Dogecoin price but also futuristic step towards crypto payments, what do you think about this? have you purchased Cyberwhistle using Dogecoin?
