You may linked your website, videos and reviews on social network post or article but have you ever heard of linking videos, website and reviews to physical object? It is new concept but it's possible using this app named IOTI where you can easy scan physical objects using camera and attach and display content with it and share with anyone.

  

On IOTI, all you just need to do is point the camera to any physical object you like and attach website, article, social media profile and video etc, once done you can share it with anyone in the world as this method is used by content creators to increase your social media audience.

Atlast, this are just highlighted features of IOTI there may be many hidden features in-build that provides you external benefits to give the ultimate usage experience, so if you want a platform to link your website, video etc anything digital to physical object then IOTI may work for you.

  

Overall, IOTI comes with simple user interface with light mode by default and there is no dark mode, right now it is in beta phase so surely iOTI require alot of UI improvements to make it modern and look attractive, blabla look cool but feel of app usage is not impressive this is why you may only get fine user experience which is little not satisfactory, so as always there is space for improvement in any project, so let's wait and see will IOTI get any major UI changes in future to make it even more better, as of now IOTI is ok to use.

  

Moreover, it is very important to mention IOTI is one of the very few platforms available out there on internet for people to link digital websites, videos, social media profile, reviews etc to physical object and share with everyone, yes indeed if you are searching for such platform you can consider IOTI for sure.

  

Finally, this is how you can link websites, videos, social media profiles, reviews etc to real physical object, are you an existing user of IOTI? If yes do say your experience with IOTI and mention which feature you like the most in our comment section below see ya :)
