There are alot of apps available for video meeting & group conferencing but not all of them enough capable to use due to bugs & optimisations.

  

The major apps available for video meetings was google meet & zoom cloud meetings.

  

While google meet was recently made it free but it was paid service before, zoom cloud meetings are always free.

**Review** : **google meet** by google llc. google meet is simple and very less size and secure compared to any other video conferencing apps it does provide all the features required to be a complete video meet app but what it lacks is the video quality seems low compared to **zoom** & the data usage is higher than zoom in google meet, except this things google meet certainly good.

**Review** : zoom by zoom.us is simple & clean but higher in size but provide all the features but only limit 100 users while in google meet it is 250 + users in terms of features & optimisation, video quality and data usage zoom is alot better than google meet.

  

**Overall**, both of apps are very similar it is best to decide yourself and decide but in our review we think zoom cloud meetings is better, however it doesn't support 250+ members so opt based on your requirement and preference.

  

**Finally**, which app you prefer the most google meet or zoom cloud meetings do mention in our comment section below, **see ya :-)**
