If you side-load apps by downloading .apk files from websites like APKMirror.com or Apkpure.com or any other popular .apk file providing websites you may probably know they provide millions of .apks which you can easily able to install on your android devices for free without the requirement of app store like Google Play which will help people who don't have access to Google Play like for example : people from countries where Google Play or Google services banned or restricted like china, iran etc.

  

But, do you know most of these .apk file providing websites switching from .apk file format to the latest .XAPK file format  which is an advanced format that provide numerous advantages and better then .apk but .XAPK is currently not supported by Android's package installer, so you can't install this .XAPK files on Android which is surely a drawback but Google may soon update It's software or package installer to support installation of .XAPK files but right now it is not supported officially.

  

However, if you have a requirement to install .XAPK files you can install them using an alternative package installer which supports installation of .XAPK files unofficially but we have very few package installers out there on android which will support to install .XAPK files on Android.

  

Yes, the main reason that you need to prefer .XAPK files over .APK files is Google Play limited the app size to 100mb but that doesn't mean developers can't make apps bigger then 100mb but for that they have to create obb externally and make users to install them later but in .XAPK file format you don't need to download obb after the app installation because obb and assets can be integrated prior including that this .XAPK files are less size compared to .APK which saves your data and time.

  

if you like to install .XAPK files it is always better to use the best .XAPK file package installer available out there from trusted source and entity else you may face issue later, so in this scenario we have a work we found one reliable and trusted .XAPK file format package installer named APK Mirror Installer who is one of the most popular .APK and .XAPK file provider with largest collection.

  

APKMirror Installer is currently in early access phase and available on playstore  which ensures safety as most apps available on play store is scanned by Google and protected by Play Protect, APKMirror Installer is better then other .APK package installer apps because APKMirror Installer also support the installation of app bundles, .apkm and split apks including .XAPK which is additional advantage which you don't get find in some .XAPK installers, so do you got your attention & interest on APKMirror installer ?
