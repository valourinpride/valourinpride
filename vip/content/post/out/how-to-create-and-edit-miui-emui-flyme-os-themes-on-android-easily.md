Android is most popular free and open source GUI aka graphical user interface mobile operating system from american search engine giant Google acquired in year 2005 for $50 million which was unveiled in year 2007 along with open hand alliance and released in year 2008 first appeared in HTC Dream from then it is continuously competing edge to edge with iPhone's closed source operating system iOS in all matters either it's customization or security etc.

  

Fortunately, almost all companies who were unable to use iOS as it's closed source started using Android public source code available on AOSP aka Android open source project to build thier own custom version of Android and load on thier smartphones due to that Android powered smartphones not only become less expensive but also eventually rised up as dominant mobile operating system with more then 70% world wide market share.

  

Google owned smartphone brands like Nexus and Pixel smartphones comes with pure stock Android which is nice but lack certain features that's why or any other reasons many mobile companies build thier own custom version of Android with extra optimizations and enhancements like additional or removed features based on hardware of smartphones or demand from users like Xiaomi's MIUI, Meizu's Flyme OS, Huawei's EMUI etc.

  

The open eco system and availablility of many features without rooting along with several custom softwares is the reason why Android is known for customization more then security including that alot of third party developers using AOSP since long time making custom Android roms by futher extending features and options that will increase usage possibilities.

  

But, In order to install custom Android roms you have to pick right one that was exclusively developed for your device and then unlock bootloader and flash correct custom recovery like CWN or TWRP etc by following correct instructions from trusted platforms like XDA which is definitely not  easy task for newbies and also completely voids device warranty that's why most of them use OEM custom Android softwares provided by mobile companies.

  

We have thousands of custom Android softwares out of them Xiaomi's MIUI since long time has custom skin with alot of fabulous features that are not only un- available on stock Android but also other mobile companies custom Android softwares which is why alot of people prefer and like even consider MIUI as favourite and buy Xiaomi smartphones.

  

MIUI is quite astonishing suitable for those who don't like stock Android and want fully custom Android software which also has theme stores where you will get thousands of themes provided by Xiaomi Inc. and third party developers along with designers which you can simply check and preview then apply completely to change look and feel of Android isn't cool?

  

Theme stores not only available in MIUI but also in custom Android softwares which is not available on stock Android versions mainly on pixel devices who can use substratum theming engine that was not up to mark to compete with theme stores which is why it's better to choose custom Android softwares like MIUI for full fledged customization on go.

  

Generally, most people who use MIUI or any custom Android softwares usually consider as enough or limit themselves to available themes but only some of them want to create thier own or edit existing theme to customize it as per liking based up on thier requirements and preferences for such users many developers created few theme creators and editors for PC.

  

If you're some one who use MIUI and want to create your own or edit existing MIUI theme then few years back you must have to know coding and graphic designing but now there is an existing software that will surely simplify the work available for PC personal computers named Universal MIUI theme editor you may use others as well.
