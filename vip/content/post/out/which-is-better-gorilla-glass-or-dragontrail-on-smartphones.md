If you have an electronic product that only have physical buttons then it's fine but incase it has display then most likely that has software which you have to access to make electronic product hardware run it's mechanisms in simple display will work as medium to connect software that will let you control hardware as programmed by manufacturer of electronic product.

  

Especially, display is essential part of personal computers and smartphones which people have to see and use every second to access operating system that's basically a software where you can do alot of digital works most people use it to play music and watch videos etc as display is first thing people see it has to be good so companies around the world used number of display technologies to improve display quality and clarity to get better experience on personal computers and smartphones.

  

Personal computers aka PC has big displays like you'll find 14 to 24 inches display and in order to use it's software you have to use mouse and most people use PC on lap or table so very likely most PC displays don't get scrathed or damaged but in case of smartphones people can easy hold in one hand and move anywhere as they are just 4 to 6 inch in size you can put them in your pockets as well.

Â   

Most people use smartphone roughly when they walk, run and work even put it in on hard surfaces and pockets with keys and coins etc so there is high probability smartphones get scrathed or damaged by falling from heights but unfortunately most mobile companies don't add any protection to shield display but thankfully we have screen protector and tempered glass to protect display of smartphone.

Screen protector and tempered glass is cheap made up of plastic or glass is an additional product that you have to buy from stores to add on top of smartphone display which will protect you from minor scratches but it can't protect display from heavy damages so if you accidentally or intentionally fall your smartphone from heights then for sure display will be broken to repair that you have to replace display on smartphone that's bit expensive.

  

There are millions of smartphones out there on online and offline market with it's own specifications each mobile company make different quality and feature smartphones based on price and several factors according to thier financial condition and marketing plans etc generally most mobile companies strive hard to provide best quality smartphones at low price possible thus most people like to buy them as they are value for money.

  

Fortunately, most mobile companies over the years used and developed number of display technologies like QVGA, TFT, LCD, LED, Amoled, OLED etc to improve screen resolution and angles including that they also released smartphones with scratch free and drop resistant displays like Gorilla Glass and Dragontrail etc.

  

However, some mobile companies especially china and India smartphone brands don't use any scratch free and drop resistant displays they don't even specify what kind of protection added on display so be careful if you're someone who slip smartphone frequently from top locations then make sure to get scratch free and drop resistant display smartphone.

  

Anyhow, Gorilla Glass is most popular scratch free and drop resistant display made by american company Corning first used on iPhone 3G later on several mobile companies started using Gorilla Glass so eventually Corning upgraded Gorilla Glass display to make it more scratch free and drop resistant for latest smartphones due to that now we have Gorilla Glass 7.

  

While, Dragontrail is also scratch free and drop resistant display best alternative to Gorilla Glass developed by AGC inc japan company which is mainly used by china and India smartphone brands like ZTE, Alcatel, Lava, ZOLO, LYF, Gionee etc even some American companies like Google, Blackberry, Samsung used Dragontrail glass on some of it's smartphones.

  

Apple inc, also use Gorilla Glass on almost all iPhone except some with sapphire glass like iPhone 7 camera lens they never used Dragontrail it seems like Apple want to use Sapphire glass on iPhone as it's much more scratch free and drop resistant display then Gorilla Glass and Dragontrail but in recent years Apple is in some issues with Sapphire glass maker GT advanced technologies so they are asking Corning to make Gorilla Glass for new iPhone model.

  

Majority of American mobile companies use Gorilla glass on thier smartphones even some china mobile companies like Xiaomi, Meizu use Gorilla Glass on it's smartphones anyway if you like to buy American mobile company smartphones then most likely you'll get Gorilla Glass else Dragontrail.

  

In terms of quality both Gorilla Glass and Dragontrail make thin, light and damage resistant displays so far as per some testers Gorilla Glass got little extra points to Dragontrail that make no big difference as in real life usage patterns opposite may happen which is why it's completely fine to select Gorilla Glass or Dragontrail.

  

SCHOTT is an German glass company that also make scratch free and drop resistant displays named Xensation for electronic products that include smartphones but it is less popular Vivo S12 Pro is first phone to use SCHOTT Xensation from then few more Vivo smartphones also started using SCHOTT Xensation but most people don't know about SCHOTT Xensation as most mobile companies don't use it.

  

There are very few smartphones out there on market that use SCHOTT Xensation so you may not get many options anyway if you don't want Gorilla Glass or Dragontrail display then you can go for SCHOTT Xensation but it was right now limited to some smartphone brands like Vivo.

  

SCHOTT Xensation claims that the display they make are much tougher and stronger then Gorilla Glass but there are no official comparison tests from them even if SCHOTT Xensation displays are better then Gorilla Glass or Dragontrail yet not many mobile companies use it so probably you may not find your favourite smartphone with SCHOTT Xensation.

  

But, SCHOTT Xensation display technology is promising like Gorilla Glass and Dragontrail they just have to partner with more mobile companies to reach and get recognition from large percentage of users but right now most people don't know about SCHOTT Xenstation as they're using Gorilla Glass or Dragontrail.

  

Anyhow, even scratch free and drop resistant display can only protect smartphone screen to certain extent they will also get damaged if more then supported force applied there is a scale of 1 to 9 level display tests while Gorilla Glass and Dragontrail get scratched at level 6 using right material.

  

Thankfully, in case you're smartphone don't have in-built Gorilla Glass or Dragontrail then you can simply buy Gorilla Glass or Dragontrail screen protector online and apply on you're unprotected smarphone display but it's always better to buy smartphone that has in-built Gorilla Glass or Dragontrail display for safety.

  

Finally, Sapphire glass is better then Gorilla Glass and Dragontrail but it was only available on iPhone and HTC U Ultra so you have to choose between Gorilla Glass, Dragontrail and Xensation all of them can protect display very well, are you an existing of Gorilla Glass, Dragontrail or Xensation if yes say you experience and mention which display is best and why in our comment section below, see ya :)
