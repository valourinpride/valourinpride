We have many revolutionary electronic devices developed by number of inventors and companies around the world out of them electronic PCs is one which is an evolution of computers but Integrated with CLI aka command line interface or GUI aka graphical user interface operating system basically digital software that allows you to install numerous additional softwares developed using programming languages which can execute and run almost all real life tasks electronically and digitally.

  

Internet is standard protocol created by ARPANET which provide unique address to each and every PC designed to move data on network at first it used to send digital messages between computers but later on in year 1991 Tim Berners Lee developed  and released quite revolutionary browser that can crawl public contents which are in format of websites due to that the usage of Internet increased immensely.

  

Fortunately, In just few years alot of people around the world using various programming languages build numerous revolutionary websites and blogs for articles by buying domain name for identity and then using PC storage and memory to create server and host them on internet after that using it's domain URL aka uniform resource locator access on world wide browser isn't amazing?.

  

Web 1.0 started in year 1990s at that time websites and blogs are developed using HTML aka hyper text markup language programming language thus websites are basic even browser softwares are same but eventually by web 2.0 era started in early 20th century people begin using numerous programming languages like JavaScript, CSS, PHP etc due to that we got many modern websites and blogs and to open them numerous developers and companies build and released many powerful and advanced browsers.

  

Even though, you can directly open websites and blogs using it's URL also known as links on browsers but in order to get urls you have to use search engines which using it's powerful and advanced bots crawl Internet then index them in simple format to it's users based on search keywords and other additional factors that people can see and click to visit website and blogs etc anywhere and anytime which all played major role in driving world wide web to success.

  

There are numerous search engines available on browsers out of them Google from Alphabet inc. previously known as backrub founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in year 1999 is well known and most popular one which is way better and much faster then other search engines with alot of options and features but at the end it is search engine so companies or users as per linking and preferences can add their own search engine on browser due to that Google is missing out users for sure.

  

However, Google back in early 20th century itself is leading search engine globally which is great but they didn't have their own browser at that time in year 2007 Sundar Pichai Google software employee understood that it is must for search engine to have browser so he speaked out his plan and project after approval he with his team developed and released browser named Chrome.

  

Chrome is first browser from search engine giant Google at first released on PCs then as time goes available for other electronic devices mainly smartphones, tablets etc which provide alot of features and options for cool and amazing browser experience on the go including that also provide facility to install and run number of extensions created by them or you and third party developers which can extend functionalities of Chrome but it is now limited to PC software of Chrome.

  

Generally, on majority of PC or smarphone browsers you can only use available options and features there is no way to get more isn't disappointing? as alot of people want to get extra functionalities on browsers that's why chrome and some other browsers are Integrated with extensions available officially for PCs but don't worry there are some browsers like Kiwi and Yandex to install and run chrome extensions on smartphones as well.
