On internet, to open websites, blogs etc  you have to access world wide web using browser, world wide web was created and released by Tim Berners Lee in 1991, there are two versions of www - world wide web currently available which are web 1.0 that has static websites existed from 1994 to 2004 and then web 2.0 which is currently latest version of world wide web where you can create modern websites, blogs, upload to social media network etc.

  

Now, people and crypto enthusiasts around the world are fascinated about web3 aka web 3.0 which is new version of world wide web based on de-centralised  blockchain technology that was coined by polkadot and ethereum co-founder in 2014 and before that founder of world wide web Tim Berners Lee in 2006 described web3 as semantic web.

  

However, only at the end of 2021 the term web3 was spiked and popularised with the effect of crypto enthusiasts and big profile investors especially due to DeFi platforms and wallets which use web3 so everybody who depended on DeFi platforms are keen to know about web3 and this is the one of the major reason behind the sudden surge of interest and attention on web3.

  

DeFi means decentralised finance which uses Web3.0 to provide crypo services to users, so if you're not into DeFi platforms then very likey you may not know web3.0, recently a norway based company Opera released a new beta browser that provide gateway to crypto and web3.
