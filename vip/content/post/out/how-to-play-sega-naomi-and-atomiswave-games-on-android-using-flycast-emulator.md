Computer at first is an electric machine that was later converted to electronic ones integrating operating system basically software that was developed using many programming languages which provide an inside environment in connection with hardware of computer like storage and memory to install more softwares.

  

Softwares can do any tasks electronically or digitally if programmed correctly in the beginning era computer softwares were developed for communication to send digital messages between computers but later on thanks to many developers who created numerous different categories software for various usage purposes.

  

In year 1962, Steve Russell of MIT developed and released world's first  moving graphics digital video game named SpaceWar on computer after that numerous inventors and companies around the world created better quality moving graphics digital computer video games but computers back then are big and expensive so not everyone can buy them even if they do computers are not home compatible as well.

  

Big companies like IBM - international business machines and millionaires are only able to afford them due to that the reach of computer video games is limited to some people but alot of people back in time want to play computer video games after an decade in year 1971 inventors Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney under Syzygy Engineering manufactured and released retro arcade video game machine named Computer Space.

  

Computer Space is expensive and not home compatible same as computers but it was designed for offline stores like gaming saloons and shopping centers etc with pay and use system which is super affordable as people just have to drop few money coins to get certain amount of usage time and start playing digital video games amazing isn't but ComputerSpace arcade machine failed commercially.

  

There may be many reasons behind the commercial failure of Computer Space but it's template was utilised by number of inventors and companies globally to make thier own different hardware and software version of arcade machine with it's own set of computer or custom digital video games due to that alot of people mainly teens and kids started using arcade video game machines where ever it's available.

  

Fortunately, In just with in decade we got modern arcade video game machines thanks to numerous improvements and advancements done by makers of arcade video game games due to that we got better quality moving graphics modern arcade machine video games competing edge to edge with electronic computers which got popularity world wide.

  

We have many amazing arcade video game machine but they have some drawbacks so not everyone like and prefer to use them due to various reasons mainly because in order to play arcade machine video they have to go specific offline stores, gaming saloons and shopping centers etc as they're are designed for them which is not always possible and they are big and expensive so not every can afford them and cover required and necessary maintenance expenses.

  

Thankfully, In year 1972 Magnavox company developed and released an home gaming console named Odyssey which is small in size and occupy less space to fit anywhere mainly designed for homes that you have to simply connect with television to start playing number of pre-available supported format system video games conveniently at your comfort zone.

  

Home gaming consoles are undoubtedly better then arcade machines as they are home compatible and one time purchase unlike arcade video game machines where you have to drop money coins every time to use which is why almost everyone who use arcade video game machines shifted to home video game consoles eventually because of it's flexibility that's amazing.

  

Majority of arcade machine video game makers also entered into home video game console business due to popularity in global market and in order to improve they done numerous advancements to update and upgrade options and features adapting to new technologies accordingly in that process we got numerous modern home video game consoles.

  

Now, we are in 21st century of modern video game consoles with powerful hardware and advanced software integrated with big storage and memory which are designed to run high definition and resolution heavy resources graphic intensive video games smoothly including that integration of external technologies like mixed reality that's an combination of mixed and augmented reality they provide immersive experience on the go.

  

Even though, modern video game consoles are fabulous and widely used around the world but still alot of people like to play old home console video games mainly because of curiosity and nostalgia reasons which is possible for that they have to purchase used old home video game consoles from certain offline stores or online shopping websites.

  

Unfortunately, most old home console video games are unavailable even if you got them they are expensive as they are rare which you can buy if you're collector trying to preserve old technologies but in case you're just an normal user who want to play old home console video games for curiosity or nostalgia reasons then it's not worthy as now we have modern personal computers and smartphones which have numerous unofficial emulator softwares by using them you can play all old home console video games absolutely for free.

  

personal computers and smartphones can't directly Install and run home console video games due to many hardware and software differences which is why third party developers make unofficial emulator in supported digital format using number of compatible programming languages then they implement and emulate home console hardware in software of unofficial emulators to play it's video games.

  

In sense, unofficial emulators give an home video game console hardware environment in digital format inside it's software like operating system, nutshell and virtual box where you can side load BIOS and roms to play video games any where and any time comfortably but the only drawback is majority of unofficial emulators stay in early access or alpha and beta phase for long time even years because implementing and emulating home video game console hardware in digital software is hard and takes time.

  

Third party developers are usually not associated with third party developers so they most likely don't get support and help from official home video game consoles makers in making unofficial emulators due to that they have to manually write and check code from scratch then do heavy testing and debugging to find issues and bugs themselves or reported by users when using software or while playing any home console video games due to that it's not easy right to build stable versions of un-official emulators instantly.

  

However, since long time many third party developers releasing thier unofficial video game emulator software code as free and open source project via public repositores on contributive development platforms like GitHub and GitLab etc where anyone via web can contribute and commit code to do optimizations and enhancements for improvement of softwares by adding new options and features or removing existing ones to advance unofficial emulators with bug fixes due to that we are getting stable versions of unofficial emulators bit faster and quicker then before for sure.

  

Unofficial emulators which are free and open source not just provide transparency and security but also anyone can use it's code to develop their own custom version of un-official emulator do further changes and modifications for advancements and enhancements due to that you'll find many unofficial emulators clients and ports of  lpersonal computers for smartphones and vice versa to scale up productivity.

  

Generally, personal computers and smartphones are more compatible with new unofficial emulators of modern home video game consoles as they have poweful hardware and advanced software which is why majority of third party developers concentrate on developing unofficial emulators of personal computers over smartphones.

  

In case of smartphones, which came to replace keypad mobile phones that can do almost all tasks of personal computers in its own way yet don't supppot some modern video game console unofficial emulators due to in capable hardware and software but for commercial reasons companies are constantly upgrading smartphones even third party developers due to demand working on to release unofficial emulators for smarphones so they may get them in future.

  

Anyhow, In case of Sega inc. which is popular gaming company who used to first make retro arcade machines but later entered into home console video games with final release of Dreamcast in year 2001 which is commercial failure with huge losses so after that they stopped manufacturing home consoles and shifted thier focus on developing videos games for popular home video game consoles which is going fine profitably as of now.

  

Sega inc. has several cool home video game consoles out of them Naomi and Naomi 2, Dreamcast, Atomiswave are well known and popular ones as it's Sega inc. which share same basic system architecture with different video game formats and all of them has global fanbase.

  

Naomi released in year 1998 that was succeeded by Naomi 2 and Dreamcast which is most expensive project of Sega Inc. that has super modern games so price is much higher then regular home video game consoles at that time in year 2003 Sammy corporation created and released Atomiswave home video game console  based on Dreamcast and then in year 2004 Sammy corporation merged with video game developer and publisher Sega inc. in year 2004 to form Sega Sammy holdings.

  

Anyhow, If you want to play Sega inc. Naomi 1, Naomi 2, Dreamcast, Atomiswave home console video games for you recently we found an multi-platform free and open source emulator named Flycast derived from reincast so do you like it? are you interested in Flycast? If yes let's explore more.

  

Note : Flycast emulator require BIOS aka basic input and out system program file to start home video game console system like few unofficial emulators for instance Nintendo 3DS Emulator without that you can't play Naomi 1, Naomi 2, Dreamcast, Atomiswave home console video games but don't worry we will provide them below which you have to run it first else nothing going to work gotcha? we will begin now.
