We have numerous video formats and each format has it's own technology, so you will find differences in terms of size, quality etc, people use different types of video and audio formats to get desired output for ex : .mkv or hevc with .h264 or h.265 are popular formats to get video at high quality at lowest size possible.

  

Likewise, audio also play important role in video size, if you choose a uncompressed audio format like .wav then the size of the video will be thrice larger then usual, that's why video encoders use .aac format which is little small in size compared to .MP3 but the audio quality remain intact in process, that's the reason you'll find .aac format in majority of blueray videos.

  

However, to encode videos in different formats faster you need a powerful PC with video encoding software, so people who don't have pc has no choice, but wait now a days smartphone comes with big storage and ram with powerful processor, so it is possible to encode videos without PC by using smartphones.

  

In order to encode videos on smartphone you need good video encoding app, even though we have few video encoding apps available out there on internet, most of them are not impressive you may end up with few issues, but wait there is one best video encoding app named FFmpeg which can encode video and audios in different formats for free.

  

FFmpeg name comes from fast forward MPEG, it uses set of open libraries and libavcodec to encode and decode videos and audio, FFmpeg support many formats like MPEG4, h265, h264, mp3, 3gp, aac, ogg (vorbis and theora), opus, vp8, vp9, x264, x265, ogg, vorbis, theora, opus, vp8, vp9, mp3lame, libxvid, libfdk\_aac, libvo\_amrwbenc, libopencore-amr, speex, libsox, libwavpack, libwebp, librtmp to give you proffesional experience.

  

Note : FFmpeg require Android 4.4 to work and for Andriod 11 users new rules require the app to use more confidential methods of working with files on your device, so you will have to copy/move the input files to a shared folder, such as DCIM, Movie, Music, so do you like it? are you interested in FFmpeg?
