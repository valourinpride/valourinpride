In india or anywhere in the world, people for more then few centuries used to store money in banks as they provide security to protect your deposited funds using various methods thus your money can't be stealed by thiefs easily so eventually we got many banks either private or government owned globally with numerous advancements and improvements over the years by adapting to latest technologies accordingly in that process we got modern banks.

  

The era of Modern banks begin in mid 19th century which are more secure and private then traditional banks especially they are using digital technologies like internet and digital softwares since year 1991 due to that now in 21st century we have alot of useful features and options by using them you can send money locally or internationally to any one digitally.

  

But, if you're teenagers under 18 year old  majority of modern banks don't allow you to open an bank account even if they allow very likely it's a minor bank account under super vision of parents or guardians who not just act as proof but also beneficiary so they know all your transactions which you can't stop as now we are in modern governments who don't allow minors to 

open full bank accounts atleast in india.

  

The primary fact and reason why modern governments and banks don't allow minors to open full bank accounts is because they are under 18 years old who are considered as children or teens in almost all countries including that people believe that majority of children don't know value of money due to lack of maturity so they can mis usage or manage money illegally that can cause financial or legal problems to thier parents as full banks accounts don't have any limit on spend and recieve money.

  

But, there are many matured teens who want to open full bank accounts as now a days even teens becoming entrepreneurs and running small or big businesses under company who usually open an minor bank account or use thier parents limitless full bank accounts to do any online or offline payments world wide comfortably.

  

However, majority of teens usually don't run any type of business as at that age they are primarily focused on education studying in school or college due to that they probably have no employment to earn money which is why they rely on parents 

who give pocket money to buy books or foods in canteen etc according to thier budget and financial capacity etc.

  

Even though, pocket money received from parents or anyone else can be stored on minor or student bank accounts by teens but large percentage of parents in india for instance don't allow thier children to open minor bank account for various reasons including that many teens themself don't like to open or use minor or student bank account as they have several restrictions on offline or online payments which are not suitable when thier parents regularly send huge money as pocket money.

  

Unfortunately, if you're an teen under 19 years and receive money in hand from your parents then there is no way to legally make digital payments unless you have an minor bank account which you may don't want it or your parents like to check all your digital transactions to keep check on your usages for teens like you developers and companies created Neobanks.

  

Neobanks are legal exclusively and specifically designed for teens that don't require any minor bank account instead your your parents can register with legal identification documents then simply add you and load desired amount that they want to give you as pocket money from any bank which you can withdraw from bank ATM or make online or offline digital payments with debit cards legally under control and surveillance of your parents to keep you in safe zone.

  

We have many Neobank apps in india from past few years for teens or we can also say Millennials and Gen-Z out of them few months back I found Walrus which is not available now so I searched and used few Neobanks out of them Akudo in my view seems like has potential to compete and replace Walrus considering all aspects.

  

Akudo is an india's learning focused #1 Neo banking as it integrates finanace curated content for teenagers under 19 years old which provides an Visa prepaid debit card to make offline or online digital payments or recieve money using personal links from anyone including that every time you do succesfull transactions you'll get exciting rewards in return that you can save in auto pilot to reach your products goals packed with exciting only shopping and plaza offers for enjoyment on the go.

  

Note : In case you're an parent you can onboard on Akudo with KYC in 2 minutes then load money for your child from UPI, Card or Net banking and gift Visa prepaid gift card seamlessly once done after that  you can see all your children transactions and control and manage children money with option to create tasks and block or unlock debit card to limit or restrict using money so do you like it? are you interested ? If yes let's explore more.
