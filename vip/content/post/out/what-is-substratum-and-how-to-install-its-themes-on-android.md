Android is an free and open source mobile operating system from Google developed exclusively for smartphones thus anyone can contribute or build thier own version of Android OS to remove or add additional features due to that many companies over the years build numerous custom versions of Android OS like popularly Xiaomi's MIUI, Tecno's HiOS, Infinix's XOS etc.

  

Even third party developers build thier own versions of Android OS known as custom roms like CyanogenMod, LineageOS, Omni rom etc but you can't install them directly on your smartphone for that foremost you have to unlock bootloader after that install custom recovery like TWRP aka TeamWin recovery project then install custom roms that are specifically made for your device using guides from trusted portals like XDA but it voids device warranty.

  

Thankfully, MIUI, HIOS, XOS and other Android OS custom versions provide support and theme store where you'll get thousands of amazing themes which you can simply install in one tap to customize home screen and settings etc but on stock in sense pure Android OS roms you don't get support or theme store to customize Android OS, isn't disappointing?

  

However, it is still possible to theme or customize stock Android OS which is usually available on Google's Nexus, Pixel and Android One smartphones for that all you have to do is simply install custom roms or root properly using Magisk so that you can use third party theming engines by using them you can not just theme or customize your home screen, settings but also alot of Android apps easily.

  

We have very few theming engines available on Android OS out of them Substratum is most popular one which can theme and customize your Android OS and apps using external theme apps provided by third party developers but you can't use Substratum theming engine on very olde Android OS versions as only since year 2016 with Android 6.0 marshmallow it started supporting theming engines with root access as mandatory.

  

Even though, you can also theme and customize some apps on Android OS without root and Substratum theme engine but it's not easy you have to install many tiny size apps to theme and customize one app like settings that to only if your device support it so it's always better to root and then theme or customize your Android OS using Substratum theme engine.

  

Fortunately, on Android Oreo 8.0 version using andromeda you can enable rootless mode for substratum and on One UI which is custom version of Android OS available on Samsung smartphones where you can get rootless substratum theming support using Synergy a overlay management tool that supports Android Pie 9 / 10 Q so you can use them if you don't want to root your smartphone for whatever reasons.

  

Anyhow, Substratum is powerful theming engine that works best if your smartphone is rooted but remmember in order to run Substratum smoothly you have to use best external substratum supported themes or else you will be unable to fully customize or theme your Android OS and it's apps.

  

There are thousands of amazing external substratum themes out of them giannisgx89, altankrk, Nishith Khanna, Niklas Schnettler, Harsh Shandilya, pierx, Kohlewrrk, DeadmanxXD, deapps studio etc are popular providers who has several awesome substratum themes.

  

Unfortunately, majority of external substratum themes are paid as developers put alot of time to craft and design UI elements carefully but yeah you will also find free substratum themes out of them you have to pick right Substratum theme  according to your liking to make your Android OS look and feel cool so do you like it? are you interested in Substratum theme engine? If yes let's explore more.

  

Note : Google is preventing stock roms users to install custom overlays so you may on new Android OS versions unable to run Substratum theming engine and apply custom overlays on system and user apps but old Android OS versions starting from marshmellow 6.0 to 1O Q will very likely support Substratum theme engine.
