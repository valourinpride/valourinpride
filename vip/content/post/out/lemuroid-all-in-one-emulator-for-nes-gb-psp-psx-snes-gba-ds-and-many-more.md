The era of video games started in 1960's from then people around the world started playing them whenever they get access in restaurants, pubs etc by just dropping few coins but as people driving towards more convenience some companies thought to make home compatible video games and they achieved it in early 1970's with home video game consoles.

  

From 1970's home video games consoles come to existence from atari, odyssey etc to play arcade video games like space and pong etc so people gone crazy about them and started purchasing them like they will go out of stock in minutes, later after few years many more companies like nintendo launched thier own format of video games consoles with better software & hardware.

  

There are different types of video games formats from various companies but the craze for video games only lasted until the entry of smartphones, people gone crazy for smartphones and the modern games they offer, however some people still like to play video games for nostalgic reasons and to remember thier old times.

  

However, In 20th century old video game consoles are in high price and there are alot of video game consoles from many companies so buying all of them is not good idea but due to smartphones we have today you can easily play all video games of any console including modern video game consoles of psp using app emulator that is compatible with them.

  

Eventhough, there are numerous emulator apps available for smartphones still most of the emulator apps only compatible with one or two video game consoles formats, so you have to install a new emulator app for every new format that can cause very inconvenience and may not give joyful experience on the go.
