Usually, softwares are digital platforms developed using numerous programming languages for electronic devices like PC aka personal computers and smartphones etc which provide number of features to do tasks digitally but majority of softwares build by developers especially companies are closed source which means you can't check code to verify it's authenticity or any type of malicious encrypted code so it may be risk to your privacy and security.

  

However, We still mostly use closed source softwares as companies and developers want to protect thier software code and not let any one use it for commercial or patent purposes but not everyone like to use closed source softwares mainly who want maximum privacy and security for them developers and companies started making and releasing FOSS softwares.  

  

FOSS aka free and open source softwares source code is public thus you can simply check it's code and verify authenticity then then only you can use softwares if you feel it's legit and safe even you can contribute your own code to improve or add features on that FOSS softwares or use it's code to build your own FOSS softwares, isn't cool and amazing?

  

Now a days, developers and companies making and releasing FOSS softwares for both PCs aka desktops and smartphones with it's source code on GitHub as there is huge demand from people but the problem here is popular software marketplaces like Google Play, App Store etc don't provide a seperate catalogue for FOSS softwares.

  

Generally, most popular software marketplaces available on desktops and smartphones that we use on daily basis put closed and FOSS softwares together with no icon or anything to identify which is closed or FOSS softwares due to that it's bit hard to find FOSS softwares.

  

Thankfully, the percentage of people who only use FOSS softwares increased so much since from past few years due to high demand for FOSS softwares alot of developers and companies build FOSS softwares marketplaces for both deskop and mobile operating systems thus it's easy to find and install FOSS softwares.

  

Fortunately, we have many FOSS marketplaces for Google's Android operating system out of them F-Droid is most popular one which is non-profit volunteer organization that has thousands of FOSS softwares in many categories due to that it is widely used by people.

  

Even though, F-Droid has both website and software with required features to find and install FOSS softwares but it don't have material design aka user interface and some features so to get them developers created several unofficial F-Droid clients out of them Droid-ify is popular and well known material design client of F-Driod.

  

Recently, we found another GPL3 licensed client of F-Driod named Neo Store that has material design 3 made by machiav3lli whichis minimal and comes with few extra features like fast repository syncing, easily explore new apps, pre-setup repositories etc so do you like it? are you interested in Neo Store? if yes let's explore more.
