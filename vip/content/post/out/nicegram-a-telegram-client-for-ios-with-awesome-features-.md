Nicegram have amazing features that are not available in official telegram app and it is currently only available for iOS platfrom.

  

This telegram client made using official telegram API complying TOS so you will get perfect app for telegram usage who follow all ethical measures. 

  

**Eventhough**, the first version of nicegram was 5.4.1 yet 5.7 version released in app store infact nicegram is new it is just a year but got huge popularity in app store with **4.1** rating which is impressive. 

  

It has to be mentioned nicegram is open source you can see the code in Github it does mean nicegram is safe and secure you can rely on the app as you can check the code anytime to check issues. 

  

If you have any doubt regarding privacy of this app as per app store it doesn't collect any kind of information still if you want to know detailed info check [privacy policy](https://nicegram.app/privacy-policy) of nicegram. 

  

It is interesting to see nicegram even have a in app purchase premium version while the official app itself doesn't have and they struggling to monetize telegram, telegram should take nicegram as an inspiration :)

**° The story behind nicegram °**

  

The founder and developer shared us story behind Nicegram for iOS.

  

**Tech Tracker** : Sergey, can you share us your story behind Nicegram ! 

  

**Sergey Akentev** : so, I'm a backend engineer with more than 5 years of experience, I'm a telegram enthusiast who fond of creating bots and related software. 

  

Switching from android to iOS, I realized that telegram app for iOS is not very comfortable for me. I've been looking for chat folders, filters, unblocked content  and improved translator. 

  

I've been searching for customization client with same features for a long time, but there were only old unsupported versions. 

  

I was not familiar with mobile coding but with all the knowledge and Google I've successfully build the swift app using github sources and pushed first beta version to the testFight. 

  

App was named "Nicegram" because it's a " Nice Telegram". I want to show everyone that's how nice the telegram app can be. 

  

Nicegram got a lot of positive feedback from my first testers. the day I realized who if not me will create best iOS alter- native telegram client? there the long & cool story of nicegram begins! 

  

**Tech Tracker** - Thank you ✌
