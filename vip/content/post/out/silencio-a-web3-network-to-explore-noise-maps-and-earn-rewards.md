Noise, do you know what exactly is this? It's basically word used when certain sound is at such decibels which is inconvenient and causing disturbance in anyway to fellow listeners in surroundings or anywhere else but in order to understand noise better first you must know what exactly is sound? 

  

Even thought most people already know about sound but if you are not then for you in simple sound is invisible thing that will be generated when physical materials at certain force contract eachother that travels through air in waves format but thing is with normal human eyes you can't see them, isn't that bit disappointing? 

  

However, sound strength can be scentifically measured in db aka decibals using tools including that we have number of revolutionary technologies on electronic devices developed by inventors over the years worldwide by using them you can not only record but also play most sounds electronically and digitally on the go.

  

In sense, sound and air is interconnected and the higher decibal sound you can generate using whatever things the more distance it will travel in 360° angle at the end you can not just make pleasent sounds but also unpleasent ones which are very likely considered as noises.

  

However, sound preferences are definitely user specific as each individual may have different taste of sounds like for some people even the sounds which are fully considered as unpleasant by majority of  people still feel pleasent and they like to enjoy them on the go, isn't that right? 

  

But anyhow at the end some low and mainly high frequency decibal sounds can damage ears of listeners as each living being has certain limited sound tolerance capacity so always when making sounds either physically or electronically and then listening to them always be careful.

  

If you don't then it may be not just irritating or disturbing but also damage ear canals instantly or over the time and may also cause health problems which is why a lot of people globally like and want to stay or live and travel in a quite place where is no or less noises as much as possible.

  

In queit places people most people likely able to more focus, relax, enjoy moments joyfully thought most state governments framed laws to control unpleasant noises mainly high ones whichever considered as noise pollution but thing is noises are bit hard and difficult to control anywhere.

  

Noises are thought unpleasant sounds but at the end they are basically sounds which are connected to almost everything in this universe so stopping or blocking them is not easy task though each living being may have it's own temperament of sound like some handle unpleasant sounds well while others may can't even bare them.

  

In case, you can't bare noises or even if  you can handle them well still you have to plan things accordingly and then go to area whichever suits your interests well though based on area characteristics you may estimate noise levels but unless you visit or ask someone you won't know exact present noise levels of area for sure.

  

Nowadays, we people to find routes of areas using apps like Google and Apple Maps etc which use satellite technologies but they will only show directions not noise levels what if there is an app that let let you measure noise levels of your area and also show area maps worldwide with noise levels, it will be fantastic right?

  

Web3 is future upgrade of internet which is basically concept of decentralization of  internet in which we use decentralized servers to power up internet thought Web3 already implemented on crypto currencies like Bitcoin but in recent times developers building almost all Web3 softwares.

  

Recently, we got to know about one interesting Web3 community powered network named Silencio that as said earlier let you measure noise of your surroundings and submit noise levels on sound area maps which is turning volume down noise pollution around the world.

  

The main benefits of silencio is you are not only contributing to global sound maps but for just submitting noise levels and exploring soundscapes of the world with interactive noise exposure sound map you'll get noise coins which you can soon exchange for rewards in marketplace.

  

Silencio let you access global sound censes and foster a quieter world on that you can contribute to rich global sound database or refer to earn noise coins at present be one of our early adopters of Silencio and claim share of Silencio's Beta Airdrop so hurry up before it's over.

  

Note : this app silencio designed for general sound measurement purposes and should not be used as a replacement for professional devices as silencio only measures approximate decibel levels, so do you like it? are you still interested in Silencio, if yes then let's explore more.

Bingo, now explore Silencio.

  

Atlast, this are just highlighted features of Silencio there may be many hidden features in-build that provides you external benefits to give the ultimate usage experience, anyway if you want one of the best app to measure sounds and explore sound maps around the world then at present Silencio is on go choice.

  

Overall, Silencio comes with light mode by default, it has clean and simple interface that ensures user friendly experience, but in any project there is always space for improvement so let's wait and see will Silencio get any major UI changes in future to make it even more better, as of now Silencio is pretty interesting one.

  

Moreover, it is definitely worth to mention Silencio is one of the very few noise measuring Web3 apps available out there on world wide web of internet that let you submit noise and explore sound maps of areas worldwide, yes indeed if you are searching for such app then Silencio has potential to become your new favorite.

  

Finally, this is Silencio by using that you not just help it to shape a quieter world, one decibel at a time but also mine noise coins and exchange them for rewards like vouchers, premium memberships etc, are you an existing user of  Silencio? If yes kindly mention if you know any way app that's way better than Silencio in our comment section below, see ya :)
