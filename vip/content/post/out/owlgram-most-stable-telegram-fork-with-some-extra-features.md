There are many popular social messaging platforms but Telegram is well known for privacy and security with advanced and powerful features developed by VKontakte founders Pavel durov and Nikolai durov in year 2013 after that it gone through alot of developments to provide new features regularly due to that Telegram reached top position with millions of daily users and become best alternative to Signal.

  

Usually, most social messaging platforms don't provide maximum security and privacy they even comply with law enforcement agencies but Telegram is special it don't provide any information to law enforcement agencies including that they have many features to maximize security and privacy which is why most people shifting to Telegram.

  

People, who want extreme privacy and security choose Telegram as over there you'll get numerous features and options to stay fully anonymous like you can use VPN, socks and proxies to pass traffic of Telegram through secure layers and you can also simply delete chat history in both ends in few taps anytime and anywhere.

  

if you want more extented anonymity or don't trust Telegram then you can start a secret chat with anyone and set a self destructible timer where no one can take screen shot or record video of your messages and they will be auto deleted and leave no trace on Telegram servers.  

  

Meanwhile, majority of social messaging platforms will not let you delete any chat history temporarily or permanently in both ends like Facebook eventhough Whatsapp let you delete a message but only in first 7 minutes after that all you're messages will be stored in thier cloud servers which are exploited by hackers who can extract data and publish it on www - world world wide or sell on darkweb that can be problematic to your privacy for sure.

  

Anyhow, Telegram is also widely used by creators around the world as over there you can create several public and private channels to broadcast content and groups to chat with team or community together and each one have upto 200,000 members which is mostly enough to maintain large communities but if you have more then 200,000 members then you can create more channels and groups easily.

  

In case of Signal and other popular messages like WhatsApp you can only create channels or groups of upto 1000 members thus you have to create several channels and groups in one or multiple accounts to manage big communities that is bit hard and takes time so at present Telegram is one stop social messaging platform to manage communities.

  

Especially, Telegram have alot of features and options with 1000s of advanced and powerful unofficial bots build with many programming languages by third party developers using Telegram Public API for various purposes which uses different technologies for instance AI aka Artificial intelligence to provide extra features that can manage your Telegram channels and groups efficiently and also simplify tasks of real life which are not available on most social messaging platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp, and Signal etc.

  

The main advantage of Telegram is you can store unlimited files upto 2GB file size while on other social messaging platforms like you can only send file upto 100 MB in size that further reduced based on format like for photo file size limited to 8 MB so if you're someone who like and want to use your social messaging platform as cloud storage then Telegram will work for sure.

  

Telegram is freemium social messaging platforms since it's inception but recently on June 10 this year launched a premium subscription that will double user benefits like for example : you can send upto 4GB file size which is 2GB in free plan anyway Telegram free is enough for most people unless you manage alot of channels and groups with requirement to send big size  2GB+ size files to people or community.

  

Even though, Telegram already has futuristic technologies and always strive to provide new features timely but they're some features and options missing that are required by some set of users which Telegram is probably working on to push in future but as of now they're unavailable so for them third party developers build unofficial forks of Telegram.

  

Owlgram, is open source and one of the most stable unofficial Telegram fork that uses Telegram Public API which is close to official Telegram app but has some extra required features to extend capabilities of Telegram and provide them to users so do you like it? are you interested in Owlgram?
