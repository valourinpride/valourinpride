We are now on centralised internet so most websites and apps use centralised server to go up on world web web thus websites that are hosted on centralised server can go down anytime due to various reasons like faulty settings and company server deletion or hackers hijacked site etc which will not only stop content delivery to your visitors but also cause data leaks.

  

Eventhough, we are upgrading to Web3 internet where sites and apps are hosed on numerous servers hosted by individuals around the world so no digital platform can never go down or get hacked by hackers, however web3 is still in development and only few sites  available out there on internet thus you have to no choice other then utilising centralized server platforms as of now.

  

If you're someone who hosted website on centralized servers then for sure your site can go down even if you selected reliable and reputed hosting company for instance from past few years numerous popular social platforms like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and search engine giant Google went offline, that's why in order to tackle this issue you have to build your own website monitoring site.

  

When you create website monitoring status page for your domain it will show either your site is online or offline to your visitors so if for whatever reason your site went down then they can can check live status on monitoring page and report you to fix this as soon as possible thus you will gain trust and don't loose ad revenue.

  

Previously, UpRobot used to provide free website monitoring status page with custom domain but later on they changed policies and stopped supporting custom domain on free plan, anyway it's always important to have website monitoring status page on your own domain to make it look and feel professional.

  

Recently, we found an amazing platform named Freshping from freshworks better then UpRobot with many features which support custom domain and allows you to add and monitor 50 sites with 5 minute interval for free that's enough for personal usages, isn't cool? If yes are you interested in Freshping? then let's explore more.
