Digital revolution started back in year 1980s since then not just number of existing revolutionary technologies but also new ones created by many Inventors around the world which we're widely using now on many electronic devices mainly on personal computers and smartphones like software, internet, world wide web etc which are awesome as due to them the way we work and do real life tasks not just changed but also simplified immensely and extensively. Isn't it?

  

Computers used to be mechanical machines but eventually become electronic ones when they were powered by electricity in mid 19th century at that time it was able to execute mechanical tasks electronically after that in same timeline number of inventors around the world figured out waya to run software on processor of electronic computers due to that electronic computers were able to execute electronic tasks digitally.

  

Machester baby computer back in year 1948 was the first electronic computer to execute software on it's processor after that many Inventors and companies for personal or commercial reasons created various different ways to run softwares on computers due to that now we have many powerful and advanced CLI aka command line interface and GUI aka graphical user interface softwares to execute tasks way more comfortably and conveniently.

  

However, do you know what exactly mean by digital ? In simple it is binary code like 0, 1, 1, 0 basically language that electronic computer can understand and then based on that it can do acts and run accordingly and softwares are also created using different digital programming languages which is why software is digital technology that eventually become super necessary. 

  

In 21st century, software is connected to almost all platforms globally which is why majority of people struggle without using software every day, but the only way you can access them is using the electronic devices like PCs and smartphones etc they're Interconnected and work together without them software won't works as it require hardware parts of electronic PCs and smartphones to run every time.

  

Especially, electronic devices hardware storage provided using HDDs aka hard disk drives or SSDs aka static disk drives is mainly required by digital softwares as they get stored on them to work on electronic devices after that using software you can create various different formats digital files and store them on HDDS or SSDs then later on access them using compatibles softwares on electronic devices easily isn't it super cool?

  

Even though, In beginnings you are able to store data on HDDs and SDDs or any other hardware storages Integrated on number of electronic computers but back then they used to have small storage size capacity including that in order to share digital files between electronic computers you need manual access and cable that to in short distances like 5 to 10 meters due to that sharing digital files in retro times is super hard and difficult for sure.

  

Fortunately, In year 1969 ARPANET developed Internet which is a standard protocol to move data on network between electronic computers wired or wirelessly at first it is basic and used to send digital messages between ARPANET computers but eventually Internet upgraded by many Inventors and around the world to extend it's potential and capabilities due to that by year 1980s we got much better improvised internet to use way more effectively.

  

Internet is basically network of computers at first it is primarily used to store and share digital data files and messages in first few decades but in order to do all this process it requires manual access as it's private but in year 1991 Tim Berners Lee created and released an browser software named WWW aka world wide web that can access public contents of internet which are in website format basically softwares due to that internet restrictions removed that increased its usage globally.

  

World Wide Web can access publicly hosted websites that has url to anyone in the world which is revolutionary isn't it? and yeah World Wide Web surely amazed most people who got know about it since it's entry large percentage of people and companies for personal or commercial purposes developed and released many different types of revolutionary websites using PCs to publicly gost on Internet due to them we got modern internet now.

  

In order to host websites on internet back in year 1990s people used to store website data on hardware storage and then using PCs memory to create an server that work as bridge to host publicly on internet but storage and memory has to be powerful then only it will be able to show websites to big audience on world wide web that not everyone can afford them at that time many people started using cloud hosting platforms which are less expensive and can host websites on internet easily.

  

Generally, cloud hosting platforms are created by companies but sometimes individuals as well which basically use physical hardware storage and memory but provide them digitally on website where you can directly host websites for free or by flexible purchasing paid plans which usually cost 1/100 price of high end modern PC or smartphone that's why most people shifted to them mainy from past decade, ain't you one of them?

  

Thankfully, most people started using cloud storage platforms to host thier websites or any other digital data folders and file formats like .mkv, mp4, mp3, pdf, etc due to enormous demand for big size storage and fast memory to supply many companies started providing them which will let you store and share any huge size websites and digital files efficiently.

  

However, just big size and fast storage is not enough anytime in order to protect your websites and other digital data files from hackers using man in middle attack or any other techniques they must be encrypted strongly with hardware or software then only you'll be able to store and send them securely and privately which is why since long time almost all digital cloud services using top notch secure encryption technology.

  

Usually, if you're someone who care about security and privacy online then you may know cloud service platforms use some reliable thier own or third party well known secure encryption technology like AES 128 or 256 encryption etc which are good but at the end they use 1 encryption master key so it can exploited though it's hard and takes long time, which is why it's better to use more then 1 encryption keys to be in safe zone, what do you you think?

  

Recently, we got to know about Verifyle, a 

HIPAA and PCI compliant platform that uses it's patented encryption technology Cellucrypt® which uses a combination of 6 unique encryption keys with real time streaming encryption for each and every individual digital file and protect them from ransomware to so do you like it? are you interested? If yes let's explore more.
