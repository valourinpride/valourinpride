Crypto currency is a decentralized digital currency first created in year 2009 by Satashi Nakamoto with Bitcoin to replace fiat currency and middle banks which are known to have several trust issues as per him crypto currency are way more secure  as they are tamper proof so you'll get way better security and control over assets.

  

Even though, crypto currencies are not completely private as anyone in the world can check full assets and transactions of specific crypto network wallet through it's blockchain where all your transactions are recorded and publicly available except few private coins like Monero but fortunately no one know your personal details which is why crypto currency is known for best privacy and transparency.

  

Bitcoin is ultra valuable now but in early days like any product bitcoin is not popular and worthy so alot of people who have thousands of bitcoins lost them while some people sell thier bitcoins for pizzas which are now worth of millions of dollars as Bitcoin is super modern and advanced  crypto currency slowly received huge global attention that's what Satoshi Nakamoto wanted from start.

  

The founder of first decentralized crypto currency satoshi nakamoto didn't wanted huge attention instead he preffered slow and stable growth of Bitcoin for stable success that eventually worked out but Satoshi Nakamoto only active in Bitcoin development till 2013 since then no one know who is Satoshi Nakamoto and what happened to him that increased the value of Bitcoins exponentially to new heights.

  

Thankfully, the team recruited by Satoshi Nakamoto continued the development of Bitcoin due to its popularity and futuristic technology as Bitcoin keep on growing in value people around the world started buying and storing bitcoins in thier crypto wallets for long time to sell them in future and get higher returns that decision made many people millionaire and billionaire.

  

The success and rise of Bitcoin especially it's advanced and powerful technology inspired companies and developers to make thier own crypto currency like Bitcoin then in year 2015 Vitalik burik a russian developer with his team created Ethereum that eventually got popularity and become competitor to Bitcoin.

  

Ethereum is right now just behind Bitcoin it was unable to reach top position of crypto crypto currency list may be because of it's high transaction fee and scalability issues but Ethereum is a crypto network where anyone can create thier own crypto token using Ethereum while in Bitcoin you can't create your own crypto tokens.

  

Tokens are subset of crypto currency as not everyone can afford and make thier own crypto currency they started creating thier using crypto tokens using Ethereum blockchain but as Ethereum has high transaction fees known as gas fees crypto investors and enthusiastics people wanted best alternative to Ethereum then we got Binance smartchain.

  

Binance smartchain is highly scalable thus you will get very low transaction fees including that you can simply create crypto tokens using Binance like Ethereum since it's very easy to create crypto tokens techies around the world started making thier own crypto tokens and listing them in centralized and decentralized exchanges.

  

Few years back, it's simple to create crypto tokens but not everyone able to create them as to create crypto tokens you need some coding knowledge but now we have  many platforms where you can create crypto currency or tokens without coding thus many people creating thousands of crypto currencies and millions of tokens inspired by Bitcoin and Ethereum etc.

  

But, on most platforms you need to pay big amount of money to create crypto token on crypto currency mainnet then only you were able to sell them on crypto exchanges while testnets allow you to create crypto tokens for free but you can't sell them on crypto exchanges they are developed to learn and test crypto tokens.

  

Recently, we found a platform named Smart Contracts where you can create crypto tokens on Binance Smartchain, Ethereum and Polygon mainet blockchain under 1$ with some restrictions so if you want complete features there are number of amazing paid plans so do you like it? are you interested in Smart Contracts? If yes let's explore more.
