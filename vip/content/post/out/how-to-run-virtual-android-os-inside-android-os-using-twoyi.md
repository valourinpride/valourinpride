I'm sure majority of people who reading this article own or use smartphones isn't it? but have you ever thought to know it's history? If you do or not now we are going to say you in simple how it's all begin then will get back to Twoyi in this way you will understand and appreciate Twoyi project more if you're Android enthusiast like me.

It's possible that you may already have basic idea about smartphone yet still for those people who don't know in simple smartphone is integrated with hardware parts that work on charge of included batteries which are powered by electricity or any other like solar or wind energy etc and they are basically small in size due to that smartphone is known as handheld electronic device, isn't interesting?

Smartphone is evolution of mobile phones and PDAs aka personal digital assistants due to that smartphone not just send and receive telecom calls and messages but also execute and run almost all tasks of PCs aka personal computers in it's own way efficiently including that smartphone as said earlier is handheld device so you can easily use them on move like walking and running etc which is hard on big PCs that's why a lot of people like and prefer to use smartphones over PCs for sure.

Apple inc. well known PC maker made world's first revolutionary multi-touch display technology smartphone named iPhone to totally replace mobile phones was launched by its founder Steve Jobs in year 2007 on January 9 with closed source hardware and operating system basically software developed using many required programming languages at first it has no name but from iPhone 2 Apple inc named it as iOS which is super cool.

iPhone comes with in-built powerful hardware and software though not to the level of PCs yet they are one of the main reasons why many people around the world used to stand in long queues outside of Apple inc. stores to buy them due to that Apple inc. was able to sell iPhones in less time and make big profits quickly because of that since the beginning itself iPhone got immense success commercially.

The continuous growth and presence of iPhone eventually dropped sells of PDAs and keypad mobile phones that became problem to number of companies so they to get back hold on market and survive in this competition of capitalist world started making plans and strategies to make their own smartphone like iPhone but as it's fully closedsource most of them instead relied on open source hardware and softwares to make useful and amazing smartphones.

Fortunately, there are numerous big companies like Nokia and Samsung etc who have potential and capability to make quality hardware for smartphones but what they lack is operating system like iOS at that time search engine giant Google in year 2008 in partnership with HTC developed and released the world's first Android powered smartphone named HTC Dream G1.

Google actually buyed Android operating system for $50 million dollars from Andy Rubens in year 2005 but for whatever reasons they didn't released it publicly then after few years they developed Android and released it as free and open source project which means anyone can use it's code due to that many developers and companies who can't use iOS started building their own OEM custom Android to install on smartphones and then make business globally.

Now, Android powered smartphones has more then 70% of worldwide market share mainly because it's free and open source and less expensive than iPhones including that Android is open ecosystem at the same time flexible so you'll be able to customize it extensively which is not possible on iOS as it's closed ecosystem at hardware and software level that's why people who want customization like and prefer to choose Android on the go.

But, In order to ultra customize Android you have to unlock bootloader and root your smartphone to get system level write access carefully using methods created specifically for device from trusted platforms like XDA correctly else it will hard or soft brick your smartphone which is sometimes irreparable and voids device warranty as well that's why most people stay from it, are you one of them?

When you root Android smartphone you'll unlock restrictions and limitless as you are able to edit and modify system hardware or software files as per your liking and preferences to get desired options and features with look etc including that you can install custom recoveries like TWRP then flash external softwares like different custom Android rom softwares developed specifically for your device by third party developers to get latest Android upgrades or security patches to enjoy more options and features etc due to that you'll stay up to data and use Android extensively.

However, if you don't want to root your Android smartphone may be you have new device and don't want to loose device warranty or you don't know how to do it or neither have interest to learn as it's lengthy process and risky then your are one of many people but don't worry for people like you number of developers created virtual machines by using them you can not just run additional PC softwares on PC but also Android on PC like BlueStacks.

Even though, we have numerous virtual machines to run external PC or Android software without rooting and switching to another hardware disks but almost all of them are available for PCs even now as smartphones are not yet fully powerful enough to handle virtual machines butÂ  from past few years thanks to number of skilled talented developers who created and released numerous virtual machines for Android as well, isn't exciting?

Currently, virtual machines available for Android powered smartphones are basic mainly those PCs virtual machines also known as emulators like Exagear but virtual machines that run Android OS inside Android OS of smartphones are mediocre like VMOS and Vphonegaga which don't require root and capable of running Android 10 even more on app itself including that they provide SuperSu and Magisk root support so that you can run root apps with root access on real device using virtual machines easily.

VMOS and Vphonegaga are well known popular Android virtual machines with numerous cool options and features for Android smartphones but the problem with them is they are closed source which means if developer of them encrypt any suspicious code like virus or data trackers into them you won't know unless you can decrypt them that can cause privacy and security risks, isn't disappointing?

Generally, the majority of apps available for Android or iOS are closed source but as you're thinking about using virtual machines for Android usages you have to be more pre-cautious and careful about it as if you choose closed source virtual machines to run Android it is like iOS don't you think? you may not want it right? If so then it's better to use open source virtual machines for full fledged privacy and security.

Thankfully, a lot of people from past few years giving attention and focus on online privacy due to that they are demanding open source apps and softwares where almost all code is publicly hosted on repositories like GitHub or GitLab etc thus you can check if there is any suspicious code in it which is why many developers and companies also making open source apps and software to reach all audience around the world in that process we got open source virtual machines by using them you may get more anonymity.

Unfortunately, right now there are limited number of free and open source Android virtual machines for Android smartphones out of them Twoyi is one, but do you know what exactly is virtual machine? In simple terms it's basically software developed by third party developers who emulate hardware or software of certain smartphones or PCs on app or software using several compatible programming languages to work on those other devices effectively where you can't directly install and run due to hardware and software differences conveniently.

In sense, most virtual machine softwares also known as emulators as they emulate hardware and software virtually and digitally to run on other devices but usually virtual machines are developed by third party developers who don't have any connection with companies due to that they have to create and process each and every file manually and debug themselves to find and fix bugs which they found or reported by users that's why majority of virtual machines for PCs or smartphones take long time to become stable.

In order to speed up development of virtual machines or any softwares for PC or smartphones etc from past few years many developers publishing thier software code as free and open source on public repositories like GitHub where anyone on web can commit their code to fix bugs or optimize and enhance softwares etc due to that we are moving from alpha is beta to faster stable software releases so that you are able to use them smoothly.

Especially, the another advantage of being free and open source software is anyone can utilize its public code to make thier own client software by improving code or design and adding more optimizations and enhancements with additional options and features etc including that you can port PC softwares to smartphones and vice versa that surely increase productivity.

In case, you only want to PC virtual machines extremely on smartphones then at present it's may not be possible as smartphones are not yet powerful and advanced enough to handle them that's why most developers focus on PCs but from past few years almost all companies continuously upgrading smartphones due to that a lot of developers creating new or porting existing virtual machines for smartphones so we may definitely get support of them in future.

Anyhow, remember Twoyi? the one we notified you in start? well it's time to know about it I hope you got basics properly, Twoyi is basically rootless free and open source light weight super fast Android virtual machine with in-build custom rom support comes under 300MB in size and boots in 3 seconds created by developer Weishu that provide Android 8.1 oreo only with SuperSu root support as it's in beta but in future Twoyi definitely get Android 10 and Magisk root support to customize Twoyi Android OS immensely.

Note : Twoyi, is still in early beta phase which means development is in progress so you may find bugs or a limited number of features but eventually Twoyi may fix all issues and release more interesting and exciting features in future, so do we got your attention? are you interested in Twoyi ? If yes then let's explore more.
