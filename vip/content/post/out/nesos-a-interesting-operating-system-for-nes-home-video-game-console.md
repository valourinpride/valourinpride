The era of digital video games started in year 1962 when Steve Russell of MIT with his team created world's first true digital home video game named SpaceWar for 

DEC PDP-1 mini computer then afterwards many Inventors and companies created thier own video game which are basically moving graphics developed using number of programming languages like HTML5 and JavaScript then build and integrated into compatible software format based on operating system of computers.

  

But, Computers back then powered by electricity with storage and memory used to be quite big and expensive thus not everyone can afford or arrange space for them and they are mostly limited to few people in big companies like IBM and in technology universities which is why alot of people unaware of digital video games of computers even if they do buying an basic computer is hefty task for sure.

  

Fortunately, In year 1971 Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney under Syzygy Engineering invented world's first arcade machine designed for offline stores like shopping malls and gaming saloons etc that can play computer video games which is pay and use model where you have to just drop few pennies to play certain amount of time but for whatever reasons Computer Space is not commercially successful.

  

However, Computer Space is stepping stone which provided template and inspired many companies globally to make thier own cool custom hardware and software arcade video game machines which attracted all ages of audience mainly teens and kids who are unable to purchase computer due to that they got immense popularity around the world.

  

Even though, arcade video game machines are definitely better then computers if the person want completely gaming centric experience but they are not one time purchase and home compatible due to that some people used to not prefer and like them as it's not always possible to go outside for offline stores wherever arcade video game machine is available.

  

Thankfully, Magnavox company in year 1972 just one year after Computer Space developed and released home compatible video game console named The odyssey which amazed alot of people as you just have to connect it to television to simply start playing pre-set system digital video games after that number of companies for commercial reasons developed thier own custom home video game consoles.

  

Majority of computer and arcade video game machine users eventually shifted to home video game consoles as they are better and user friendly and over the years companies upgraded home video game console extensively due to that now we have modern home video game consoles designed to play heavy resources high definition graphic intensive games with option to use additional technologies like virtual and augmented reality to get real life immersive experience on the go.

  

Now, most people use modern home video game consoles but some people still like to use old home video game consoles because of nostalgia reasons who may already have them if not then they have to buy used old home video game consoles from offline or online stores as companies stopped making them long time ago thus they are rare which is why availability is not guaranteed even if you find the one it's most likely expensive, isn't right?

  

There are number of home video game console companies out of them Nintendo is one a japanese company well known for mixed reality technology popular game Pokemon Go who are actually renowned and pioneer in making home video game consoles started it's bussines in year 1983 with NES - Nintendo Entertainment system also known as Famicon family computer.

  

NES is one of the world's most popular and Nintendo's first home video game console which has thousands of cool retro classic digital video games well liked even today at the time of modern games that's why alot of people mainly from year 1980s and later on show interest to play NES home console video games.

  

If you already have NES home video game console then it's fine but if you are trying to buy it to simply play games then it's not worthy as now we have many un-official emulator softwares to play almost all NES home console video games created by third party developers using number of programming languages for personal computers and smartphones.

  

Usually, home video game consoles out of box can only run pre-set or external supported format video games isn't? but do you know few developers created operating systems for home video game consoles atleast in case of NES which already have Windows 98, XP, 2000 and now a brand new better operating system came up named NESOS by Inkbox.

  

Generally, computers and smartphones comes with CLI aka command line interface or GUI aka graphial user interface operating system basically software that allows you to install more softwares but operating system available on NES are basic which just provide look and feel of desktop or mobile operating system of Windows or Linux etc but it is something that increases curiosity.

  

NESOS is way better then existing operating systems available on NES programmed in 6502 assembly and compiiled using CC65 which has many features and options to name few word processor, 53 desktop background colors, 7 different cursors, file manager, settings including that it uses 2K NVRAM to save upto 8 sessions, compatible with family basic keyboard etc fantastic right?

  

In order to try out NESOS that was released few weeks back you either require NES home video game console or emulator software gotcha? we have numerous NES emulators for both personal computers and smartphones for operating system like Google's Android we selected Nostalgia.NES considering as top pick but you may choose others as well.

  

Note : it's been the very first version of NESOS yet working smoothly but if the developer publish it as free and open source project via public repositores on contributive development platforms like GitHub or GitLab etc then it will rapidly progress further don't you think? so do you like it it? are you interested in NESOS?
