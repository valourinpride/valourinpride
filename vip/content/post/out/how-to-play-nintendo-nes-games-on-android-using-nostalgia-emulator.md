Back in olden days, we don't have modern smartphones and personal computers at that time home gaming consoles used to be the only choice available for people to play games from home or indoor spaces as they are super cool home video game consoles quickly become popular since the entry of home video game consoles people around the world started playing  them over outdoor physical games.

  

Home video game consoles allow you to connect and play video games on your TV or console using gamepad that has some buttons which you have to tap according to instructions set by video game inorder to play amazing video games as it's user friendly and comfortable people who can't play physical games shifted to home video game consoles.

  

But, the era of home console video games got big break in 21st century with release of modern PCs aka personal computers and smartphones that has powerful hardware and advanced software with millions of high graphic digital games that are comparable to video games thus since then sells of most old home video game consoles dropped every year except modern home video gaming consoles like Sony PlayStation and Microsoft Xbox series etc.

  

There are numerous home gaming consoles and each console has it's own format video games thus you can't play one home console on another as it don't support because of different hardware and software limitations thus in order to play different video games you have to buy number of home console video games which are bit expensive and not worthy thus most people not showing interest in home video game consoles except some gamers for nostalgia reasons.

  

Even though, some people still like to buy old home video games yet majority of them don't instead they want and demand to play video games on modern PCs and smartphones that is actually not possible in early of PC and smartphones even now it's near to impossible to directly run video games on PC and smartphone OS due to different hardware and software with system limitations.

  

But, smartphones over the years gone through rapid developements due to that now we have alot of unofficial emulators  created by talented third party developers that can fullfill the demands of those who want to play home console video games on latest modern PCs and smartphones.

  

Fortunately, third party developers around the world created number of unofficial emulators to play almost all old and new home console video games on modern PCs and smartphones but as third party developers are not associated with home console makers they don't get any support due to that third party developers need to work hard and check many files to make PC or smartphone hardware and software  compatible emulator that takes time which is why most unofficial emulators stay at early access phase even being an open source projects on GitHub or GitLab.

  

On unofficial video game emulators you have to dump BIOS and home console video games from your own real home video game console that is legal method else you have to download pirated version of BIOS and video games from internet then load it on your unofficial emulator which is illegal method that was currently used majority of unofficial emulator users.

  

Unofficial emulators are apps and softwares that are specifically developed to run home console video games on PC and smartphones instead of trying to install video games into PC or smartphone they will install and load home console video games on app and software thus it's possible to run video games on modern PCs and smartphones.

  

Recently, we found an unofficial emulator to play world's most popular japan video game company Nintendo's first home video game console released in year 1983 " Nintendo Entertainment System aka NES video games on smartphones using Nostalgia.NES emulator,
