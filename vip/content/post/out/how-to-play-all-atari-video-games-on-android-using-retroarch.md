Steve Russell, in year 1962 developed and released world's first true video game named SpaceWar to run on digital computer after that many inventors and companies created number of video games which are developed using various programming languages but back then computers are basic yet expensive so not everyone can afford them due to that they are limited to few millionaires and big companies like IBM. 

  

Computer video games are basically softwares developed using various programming languages in format visible on monitor display known as moving graphics at first they are basic but eventually computers gone through alot of advancements with improvements and upgrades in hardware and software in that process we got much better visible digital computer video games.

  

Fortunately, the list of video games available on computers increased drastically with improved moving graphics that attracted more audience but still computers are quite big and expensive so the reach is limited to set of audience at that time in order to provide computer video game at affordable prices in year 1971 inventors Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney company Syzygy Engineering developed and released ComputerSpace.

  

Computer Space is completely arcade video game machines you will not find anything else which is less expensive then computers but has pay and use system in that people must drop pre-set amount of  money coins to get certain amount of play time thanks to it's revenue model many offline stores and gaming saloons around the world started buying and setting up to make bussines which people mainly kids and teen begin using on daily basis.

  

The demand and popular of arcade video game machines keep on growing due to that many companies around the world started making thier own of version of archade video game machine with it's own different hardware and software adapting to latest technologies with advancements and improvements accordingly due to that by year 1990s we got modern number of cool arcade video game machines.

  

Even though, arcade video game machines are better then computers as it's not only totally gaming centric product but also allows you to play computer's or it's own set of video games with few money coins but there are some drawbacks like it's not one time purchase and whenever you like to play arcade machine video games you have to go wherever it's available which is not always possible including that as they are for not designed homes you need huge free space at the same time and so much money to cover maintenance expensives.

  

In sense, if you don't have any revenue generating model on the purchased arcade video game machine it's difficult to get back the money that you spend on it unless you sell it which is why arcade video game machines are more suitable for offline stores where they can get alot customers to pull out satisfactory profits as well but in case you just buy fully for personal usages then it's fine.

  

Thankfully, In year 1972 Magnavox company developed and released world's first small size home video game consoles that can be connected to any television to play video games anytime and anywhere at your convenience in comfortable zone at that time same year Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney founders of ComputerSpace co-founded Atari a home video game console to stay up to date.

  

Atari manufactured and released both home video game consoles and personal computers who launched thier first home video game console in year 1977 named Atari VCS 2600 after that they released several video game consoles then ended in year 1993 with it's final home video game console jaguar and all of them are quite popular around the world.

  

Now, we are in era of modern video game consoles which have poweful hardware and software that will allow you to play heavy resources high graphic intensive video games with several cool additional technologies which have potential and capability to provide complete immersive experience on the go with mixed reality.

  

Modern home video games has big market globally which may be the reason or any other commercial aspects after long time Atari in year 2017 get back to bussines of home video game console and crowded funded for modern version of Atari VCS released in year 2021 after set backs that alot of Atari fans like but some of them prefer and want to play old Atari home console video games out of curiosity and mainy because of nostalgia reasons.

  

In order to play old Atari video games or any other you have to buy it's home console which they stopped making and selling a decade back atleast but if you have strong commitment to play them then you have to buy used ones from certain websites as they are rare you may not find all of them even if got the one you like which is probably expensive isn't?

  

Generally, almost all classic video game consoles including Atari are costly so only if you're an collector then it's fine but in case you planning to buy them for daily personal usage then they are not worthy as right now we have emulator softwares which are build by third party developers  thus they are considered as unofficial yet available on PCs aka personal computers and smartphones can run any old classic home console video games for free.

  

PCs hardware and software can't directly run home console video games due to hardware and software differences which is why third party developers make emulators in compatible digital format using various supported programming languages then implement and emulate home video game console hardware in its software thus you can play video games pretty well.

  

Unofficial emulators provide an inside hardware environment in software for video games basically like operating system or to be exact virtual box but it's really hard to such technology gimmicks which is why  which is why unofficial emulators stay in early access or alpha and phase long time as it require heavy testing and debugging from developers and useful to fix bugs and support all videos games that will eventually lead to stable versions in future.

  

Third party developers usually not connected with home video game console makers thus they don't get any help and support in making unofficial emulators due to that third party developers have to manually write alot of code and files themselves which is the reason behind the delay of stable version but to speed up the developement from past one decade they are release unofficial emulator code as FOSS aka free and open source via public repositores on contributive development platforms like GitHub and GitLab etc.

  

On GitHub anyone through web can contribute and commit code to public repositores to improve any softwares by optimising or fixing bugs and adding new features or remove existing ones to update and upgrade software with advancements and improvements due to that now a days we are getting stable versions of unofficial emulators much faster then before.

  

Especially, majority of unofficial emulators available for PCs and smarphones are free and open source project thus anyone can use it to build thier own custom versions of unofficial emulator with further optimizations and enhancements which is why you'll find official and unofficial ports of popular PC unofficial emulators for smartphones and vice versa.

  

Usually, PCs are more compatible with unofficial emulators because of it's powerful hardware and software which is why third party developers prefer and like to make unofficial emulators for PC but smartphones have more userbase and demand for un-official emulators due to that third party developers constantly working on to new unofficial emulators or port existing PC ones for smartphones as well.

  

Smartphones actually came in replacement of keypad mobile phones that has an operating system which can do almost tasks of PC in its own way still some PC unofficial emulators are not supported on smartphones mainly those modern home console video games but as companies constantly updating and upgrading smartphones with increased CPU, GPU, ROM and RAM and third party developers also striving to release PC unofficial emulators for smartphones so we may get compatibility in future.

  

Anyhow, In case of Atari home console video games they are quite old and basic due to that third party developers already build many stable unofficial emulators with numerous options and features for smartphones as it capable enough to play any old classic Atari home console video games without frame drops for sure.

  

Recently, we found an free and open source unofficial emulator cross platform software without push ads and support for Android powered smartphones named RetroArch which has Atari 2600, 5200, 7800, Lynx, ST, STE, TT, Jaguar, Falcon etc
