By using which things you can make music? if you're aware of music and has basic understanding you'll probably say we can make music from almost all things to name few voice, drums, piano, guitar, flute, tabla etc what not you can basically make  music from all physical materials as each thing when it collides with another object generate different frequency sound which will be in waves format travel via invisible air based on its frequency and offcourse wave length calculated in DB aka decibals  the higher DB we have the more distance sound will travel in 360° angle at the end ear receptors will receive sound through ear canal when sound is at right human hearable level, isn't that interesting?

  

In sense, sound makes music and the higher decibal sound you can generate the more better you can listen to music based on receiver capacity though not every sound is music but you can make every sound as music when you are able to compose and make sounds at such frequencies which are soothing and enjoyable by humans in modern terms people back in olden days to generate different types of sounds and make music people used to different types of physical materials which are still widely used by large percentage of people globally.

  

But, thing is physical music materials also known as instruments are quite big in size and you can't easily carry them with your hands everywhere like huge size pianos and drum sets including that the quality branded ones are super expensive though some people can simply afford them but there are a lot of people who can't out of them most compromise and use small size musical instruments or buy and use low cost ones even there are many people who utilise school musical instruments or other whatever physical things available to them like voice, hands, buckets etc so that they can make certain music on the go.

  

Even though making music without proper musical instruments is quite impressive talent and skill which can get you more attention and recognition from people as it's something special and different then normal but it's always better to have right musical instruments with you so that with equipment there is chance that you'll be able to make better music then previous ones right? that's why many artists, DJs, singers, musicians, composers and beat makers etc always strive to get the latest best quality musical instruments so that they can make industry level desired finest quality music and present it to world.

  

However, as said earlier music instruments are big and expensive which are not suitable for everyone unless they are performing music in public concerts where to make musical presentation more visually attractive and appealing to all the listening viewers showing off musical instruments is beneficial but thing is as you may know nowadays with the advent of many latest modern technologies most people not just remotely listening but also recording live as well as already recorded music at the same time instantly making music digitally using numerous softwares available on the operating systems of PCs aka personal computers and smartphones from their place easily and efficiently.

  

In sense, if we look back into the history though it taken few decades for evolution the making of music started from normal musical instruments to electronic and now in 20th century it can be created digitally through number of ways primarly using audio editor softwares like Audacity with them you can do many things mainly re-arragements or adjustments of existing structure to get the desired output or you can create a new project and add already recorded sounds and in process turn it as music including that you can even simply download various genre inbuild royaly free music and edit them as you want and like  to make something new and exciting.

  

You can do alot of things with audio editor softwares especially when they are feature rich like Audacity but thing is by using them you can't directly compose instruments based music unless you have and can record externally isn't that dissapointing? but even if you don't have them you can still make top grade level music in order to do that there is simple yet effective amazing workaround as you may know in 21st century we can do almost all works digitally right? which is why many developers over the years created digital form of almost all music instruments with it's sounds and tools so that people without musical instruments can also compose quite effectively.

  

Majority of advanced digital musical instruments softwares are actually available for PCs but at present many developers focusing on mobile devices and already created fabulous softwares though most of them are paid there are free ones to which are not easy to find if you want one of them to make it simple for you we recently got to know about an feature rich music composer app named that we glad to present named Toool by using that you can easily compose top notch music on smartphones extensively, so do you like it? are you interested in Toool?
