Most people know Google do magic and miracles with it's software and apps, they will improve hardware with it's software, for example : pixel smartphone cameras may not be able to compete with sony smartphone camera in hardware level but Google made a camera app named Gcam which uses various algorithms to get good picture, even improve night mode in such way that no other smartphone can beat it.

  

When Google Gcam was unvieled to public it mesmerized all smartphone users and developers, at first it is only available for pixel phones but with the help of talented developers they were able to port Gcam to other devices with alot of hardwork adding additional features on Snapdragon devices only as it is developer friendly processor so they didn't show much attention on Mediatek devices, I'm not sure about the exact reason but they say mediatek proccesor are not developer friendly and it's not easy to make Gcam port of it.

  

If you own a mediatek device and incase if you tried to install GCam in it but it will not work because most developers only made GCam ports for snapdragon devices, so if you install Gcam port or mod that is made for Snapdragon devices on mediatek then it won't work due to numerous reason and main reason will be processor differences but few Gcam port developers also added support for mediatek devices in thier port version of GCam which is appreciated, so you may able to install Gcam that is made and supported for mediatek devices.

  

However, when we tried to install some of the mediatek supported Gcam ports in our Tecno Pova which is an Mediatek powered device with G80 proccessor but there is no success most Gcam ports availabe for the mediatek devices that we tried to install in Tecno Pova doesn't work with issues like blackscreen and force stop but we didn't stopped our search for GCam that can be supported by Tecno Pova.

  

In continuous search for GCam that may work in Tecno Pova, we are glad that we found a Gcam Go mod version working perfectly in Tecno Pova, if you don't know about Gcam go it is a lighter version of GCam orginal version with less size and limited in features but does it all matter atleast we got one Google's Gcam that is working for Tecno Pova that is a mediatek device so it may also work in other devices that are powered by mediatek.

  

This GCam Go mod is created by the well known Gcam ports developer Greatness, so the name of this GCam is Gcam go v1 by Greatness and the main speciality and advantage of this GCam Go mod version is unlike other orignal GCam ports where you need to add or restore XML files to config but here in Gcam Go mod you don't need to do such things, you just need to simply install Gcam Go mod in your Tecno Pova after downloading like you do with other apps, so it's very easy and simple. So do we got your attention? Are you interested to install Gcam Go Mod V1 - Greatness in your Tecno Pova? If yes let's know little more info before we begin.
