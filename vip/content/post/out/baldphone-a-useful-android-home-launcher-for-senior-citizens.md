Each and every human being since the time of birth as time goes not just grow physically but also mentally based up on various different factors that gone through life isn't it? and each person based on thier intelligent quotient see and handle real life scenarios and responsibilities physically

or mentally, but at the time they become senior citizens like 60 or older years most human beings known as people in modern society reduce participation in numerous activities as by that time most people due to age related health levels unable to see or think and physically be active to work in home or anywhere else which is why they usually take retirement for jobs and utilise savings to move on rest of life happily.

  

If you're senior citizen and was able to work actively and happily everywhere then it's great and I hope it continues but one thing that large percentage of old senior citizens really struggle to understand is new technologies which are widely used by Gen-Z and millennials as they are young with latest education to adapt easily which are extensively used by people in allmost all sectors and fields worldwide.

  

The primary reason other then age related health problems why majority of senior citizens face hardships to understand latest technologies like mainly electronic PCs and smartphones related ones is due to lack of awareness and education etc even if senior citizens has doctorates and PhD in nuclear physics and space research still they may find it difficult to use latest technologies as they may got used to old technologies or since begginings lived no tech lifestyle etc, isn't that true?

  

Now a days, almost everyone using latest electronic and digital technologies which become necessary as they are wirelessly connecting people to get or do anything like for instance smartphone which is an evolution of telephone and mobile phone that will let you send and receive telecom based voice calls and messages to people globally anywhere and anytime easily.

  

Smartphone is basically multitouch display technology hardware based electronic device which is Integrated with latest digital technologies like operating system basically software developed using numerous programming languages, by using them you can not just able to communicate with people around the world but also can execute almost all real life tasks electronically and digitally.

  

Senior citizens unable to understand and use smartphones though it's handheld device and can be even used while on move like walking or running etc on the go  mainly due to it's digital softwares which are not well utilised by senior citizens as back then few decades back most people got used used to electronic machines to execute tasks and to communicate they very much got used to telephones which is why senior citizens usually feel complex to use softwares on smartphones.

  

Fortunately, there are numerous simple home launcher softwares with alot of options and features mainly available for Android powered smartphones by using them even layman can access and use all digital technologies quite easily but at the end they are not developed exclusively for senior citizens instead they are mostly for for Gen-Z and millennials due to that most senior citizens may find them many find then it's technical and hard for sure.

  

Recently, we got to know about well organised free and open source home launcher for Android powered smartphones named BaldPhone specifically designed and developed for elderly and senior citizens, motoric or sight handicaps and for everyone who struggle to use smartphones considering numerous factors by using they they can communicate as well as access other digital technologies conveniently and comfortably on smartphones, so do you like it? are you interested in BaldPhone?
