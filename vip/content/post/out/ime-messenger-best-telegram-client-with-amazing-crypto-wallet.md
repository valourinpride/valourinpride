Telegram is one of the popular messaging app competing whatsapp and signal but it does lack some features which are needed by certain percentage of users due to that people who are requiring certain features were not able to get them on telegram in time due to late updates but eventhough it take sometime to get users feedbacks and user requests based features on telegram they will definately come in future. 

  

Yes, Telegram doesn't have some features that are requiring by certain percentage of telegram users and will they get it or not In future is doubtful, so certain percentage of telegram users who are requiring features that are not available on official telegram app were searching for a telegram client which have additional features that was able to full-fill thier requirements. 

  

Telegram is open source they have public API which developers can utilise to make their own telegram client app with ability to add extra features and modifications due to that we are able to see Telegram clients from numerous companies and individual developers on playstore while most of them available for free but any Telegram client or bot must follow the development protocols with Terms and conditions compulsary. 

  

Telegram is one of the most used social messaging app with security & privacy is most priority due to that telegram utilised by many business magnates & celebrities to chat and do business through Telegram even it is hub of crypto bots, crypto wallets and channels, groups etc but do you ever thought or wanted to have a crypto wallet integrated on telegram to use it like the real crypto wallet on mobile? 

In this scenario, We have a workaround we found a telegram client that have a crypto wallet integrated named iMe Messenger the developers of this telegram client done a fabulous job they perfectly embed crypto wallet on telegram without disturbing the Telegram originality and simplicity, usually most Telegram clients packed with alot of features but iMe messenger is very similar and close to official telegram app with the little UI changes and crypto wallet which is main iconic of iMe Messenger that is not available on any other Telegram clients. 

  

So, if you are a crypto miner, celebrity or any individual or company want a crypto wallet to do business or want to send or receive crypto currency through telegram you can use this iMe Messenger telegram client's crypto wallet like real, it has many popular crypto currency coins wallets like Bitcoin, and with their own Aicoins with numerous features that can amaze you.   

  

However, When security and privacy is the first priority of yours then official Telegram should always be your choice because the telegram clients may contain virus, trojans, malwares etc if you install them from any un-verified unknown sources or you may able to see and get frequent bugs, errors etc on un-official telegram clients. 

  

Eventhough, iMe messenger is un-official client of Telegram that doesn't mean you shouldn't install it, it has gone through many security tests conducted by Google and Apple, After iMe messenger passed in all tests and security measurements then iMe messenger was released on Google's Play Store and Apple's App Store so, it is easy & safe to install iMe Messenger on Android or iOS for free including that iMe Messenger may available on PC  in future.
