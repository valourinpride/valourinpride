Linux have you ever heard or know about it? If you are here then you probably do but for those who don't know it's an operating system but before we cover the details of the topic let's first get into basics. do you know about electronic computers which you may be using now right? it is basically integrated hardware based electronic device evolution of mechanical computers started back in early mid 19th century at first it is used to run programmed tasks electronically but later on a number of inventors figured out a way to execute software developed using programming languages on processors of electronic computers since then it was able to execute most tasks digitally.  

In early era softwares that are executed on processor of electronic computers are not visible instead they mostly used to run in background which you have to operate and command using physical switches yet still they are used by number of inventors and companies like IBM extensively but as you can't see how software is working on it is bit inconvenient to use them for sure isn't it? In order to simplify and improve usage of electronic computers many inventors created different numerous revolutionary technologies in that process we got CLI aka command line interface operating system for electronic computers.

CLI is visible format text based operating system basically software for electronic computers in which you have to enter pre-programmed commands using keyboard to execute tasks back in early mid 19th century in order to use electronic computers there is requirement to write custom softwares which is hard and mostly scientists and mathematicians got used to them but in year 1964 to enable non scientific students to use electronic computers inventors John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz together released useful BASIC programming languages.

Basic aka Beginners' All-purpose Symbolic Instruction code is well known and popular high level programming language though not operating system yet still it's software by using that you can not just create operating systems and other softwares but also simply access and use electronic computers back then majority of people and companies got used to BASIC but later on when better and way convenient to use CLI operating systems developed and released for electronic computers like Multics and Unix etc most people around the world eventually shifted to them and they definitely changed and simplified the way we use electronic computers.

In sense, majority of people back in beginning of software Integrated electronic computers used to rely on programming language softwares and then later on got used to CLI text based operating systems but the problem here is back then electronic computers are quite big and expensive so even if you can afford them it's difficult to get space to fit them and they are mostly limited by some people and companies but due to personal or commercial reasons many companies by Integrating and adapting to their own or third party technologies reduced the size of electronic computers due to that by year 1970s we got to see PCs.

PCs aka personal computers are well small sized home compatible electronic computers at first they used to run CLI operating systems to execute tasks but the problem with CLI is they are not easy to use as well though not to the level of custom softwares and programming languages but they require you to enter pre-set keyboard commands which are not easy unless you're are programmer so a lot of common people wanted better way and alternative to utilize PCs at that time we got GUI aka graphical user interface based operating systems for PCs which are revolutionary and super cool.

Xerox company created world's first GUI aka graphical user interface operating system for PCs which is way better and convenient then CLI operating systems as you don't have to type commands to access PCs instead you'll get digital graphical representation of everything which you can access using mouse pointers isn't that amazing? after Xerox, a number of companies around the world using their own or adapting to third party latest technologies created powerful and advanced GUI operating systems due to that large percentage of people shifted to GUI operating systems which are now widely used by people globally.

Even though, GUI based operating systems are much better then CLI especially for newbies and those who want use easily like but there are many people who like to use CLI over GUI for whatever reasons mainly programmers and developers including that in some scenarios CLI operating systems are much better then GUI in terms of coding and handling certain tasks and accessing files etc that's why almost all inventors and companies Integrated CLI and GUI in one operating system thus users can get all required and necessary functionalities and tools to work in full capacity efficiently.

There are numerous GUI + CLI desktop operating systems available for PCs since year 1970s which are quite amazing but the problem is most of them are closed source so you won't know if developer of it hide any suspicious code containing data trackers or remote access trojans to access your private data unless you are an skilled developer and able to decrypt them which is hard for common people so if you're one of them and care about your privacy and security then it's always better and recommended to use open source desktop operating system on electronic devices to stay and be in safe zone.

In open source operating systems and softwares code will be in public domain online or anywhere so anyone can check it's code to verify it's authenticity and safety so you won't usually find harmful code on open source softwares thus you can better protect your private data on PCs including that there is another advantage with open source softwares as their code is public anyone can commit code to improve it or simply use to make their own custom version of softwares by Integrating additional optimizations and enhancements or even can port software to other possible electronic devices.

Microsoft Windows is well known and popular GUI operating system which is widely used around the world for personal and commercial purposes on almost all PC after fortron and basic operating systems which though provide decent security and privacy but not open source software so a lot of people who want don't want closed source softwares really didn't prefer it at that time they want want an open source operating system so to full fill that there is Linux.

Linux is an free and open source operating system developed by Linus Torvalds back in year 1992 which is used mainly by techies and geeks or programmers and developers etc, though there are number of other open source operating systems for PC but back then most users ruled out that Linux is considered as one of the best alternative to Microsoft Windows including that as it's open source many developers over the years not just constantly updated and upgraded Linux but also used it's code to develop super cool distributions also make distros like Ubuntu, Arch etc.

Now-a-days majority of people using handheld electronic devices mainly smartphones over PCs as they can be used on move and also has operating system that can do most tasks of PC out of them some even use linux like Google's Android but many people want to run desktop operating systems on Android or any other operating system smartphones which is not possible as they can't directly install and run them due to numerous hardware and software based differences or limitations and restrictions etc.

However, many developers over the years mainly from last decade created and found number of methods and techniques even tricks to run desktop operating systems on smartphones for instance they used number of compatible programming languages then emulated hardware and software of particular desktop hardware and software digitally in supported digital format software which is basically virtual environment and virtual machine to run desktop operating system smartphones.

We have many emulator softwares mainly unofficial ones like Exagear and Limbo etc to emulate and run desktop operating systems on Android which use hardware and software of your smartphones but the drawback here emulating hardware and software of PC and desktop operating systems virtually in software digitally is super hard that's why you'll find bugs and most of them for long time stay in alpha or beta access phase you may unable to install and run desktop operating systems on Android smartphones smoothly.

Recently, I got to know about an app named Andronix which is one of the best alternative to UserLAnd that provide number of linux desktop distribution softwares scripts which using Termux app from F-Droid that has all functionalities not from other platforms to store desktop operating system locally on your smartphone then it will automatically based on device hardware and software with storage and memory capabilities will create server and remotely show you the desktop linux operating that you choose on VNC Viewer which you can access and use like on PCs extensively, so do you like it? are you interested in Andronix? If yes then let's explore more.
