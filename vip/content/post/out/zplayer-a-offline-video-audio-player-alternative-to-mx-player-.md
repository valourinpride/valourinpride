MX player used to be one of the best and most popular offline video & audio player on Android packed with alot of essential and useful features but when MX player was acquired by Times India they made alot of changes like adding online music player powered by gaana & online games , online content - MX series which spoiled originality of MX player so most users who installed MX Player for pure offline video & audio player experience started leaving MX player to get better ones.

  

We have numerous offline video & audio players out there on internet while most of them certainly lack features like some offline video players doesn't have popup media player & some doesn't have inbuilt audio player feature etc including that most offline video & audio players comes with advertisements inside which many users do not like and prefer.

  

In this scenario, we have a workaround we found a offline video & audio player that is better then MX Player named zPlayer, yes zPlayer has in-built popup player, audio player, status downloader, offline games and mainly zPlayer has no ads which will give you best and complete offline video & audio player experience over MX player.
