When you got bored, there are many activities to time pass and crunch up time isn't? out of them most people prefer and  like to play games as they're not only cool but also exciting to make you enjoy, we've been playing physical games since ancient times but in 19th century industrialization happened due to that people life style not only changed but also become busy which is why large percentage of people stopped playing traditional physical games.

  

However, because of industrialization we entered into modern era with millions of revolutionary electronic products invented on daily basis by people and companies around the world in that process by mid 19th century we got computers with softwares even though computers are founded in 18th century by Charles Babbage but at that time they're mostly hardware based mechanical parts.

  

On computers, software known as operating system is created using many programming languages on that you can install more softwares which are created and programmed to do almost all physical real life tasks electronically like calls and messages etc even you can play alot of digital games but at first they're are very basic like SpaceWar, Tetris, Sudo etc.

  

Thankfully, alot of inventors and companies as computers keep on rapidly advancing people getting into PC aka personal computers they started developing much better games for computers due to that most people eventually started playing games on computers for various reasons.

  

PCs come with powerful hardware and advanced software but it is not officially created to play games which is why you'll find bugs and unsupported games to fix this issue alot of companies made home gaming consoles which are specifically developed to play games where you'll get many exclusive video games that are not  not available on computers.

  

In sense, you can't play home console video games directly on PCs as they're in different format and un-supported but thankfully many talented third party developers around the world created 

unofficial emulators by using them you can side load home console games on computers then play video games.

  

But, some home console video games are still incompatible with unofficial emulators as companies didn't optimized them to play on PCs even they don't help third party developers with code to run it's video games smoothly isn't disappointing? but now a days alot of people are not showing interest to play games on home gaming console as they're are expensive.

  

Fortunately, you can play many home console video games on PC but still it has big screen thus you can't use it easily so to replace PCs and keypad mobile phones we got smartphones which are small in size where you can play HD games just like PCs with more comfortability.

  

The demand for games on PCs and smartphones are much higher then home gaming consoles which is why developers and companies for personal or commercial reasons are developing optimized version of home console video games to support PCs and smartphones thus more people will use them.

  

We have numerous home gaming consoles out of them Sony PlayStation series is well known and popular one which has plenty of cool and amazing collection collection of video games out of them Ultimate Sackboy is one developed by Exient is not available for PCs and smartphones so to play that you have to use unofficial emulators.

  

Recently, Exient announced Ultimate Sackboy for smartphones even published on Android market place " Google Play " but later for whatever reason unpublished yet some people able to extract or we can say downloaded leaked version of game and uploaded on internet of world wide web which you can get to play Ultimate Sackboy before it's official release, isn't interesting?
