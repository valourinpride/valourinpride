Social networks are basically platforms where we can connect and message to fellow people which are now widely used by people around the world out of them well known and popular one is Twitter which is created by Jack Dorsey back in year 2009 but recently it was acquired by Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk.

  

Elon Musk making number of changes to Twitter to reduce spambots and increase privacy and security of users but the thing is Twitter is almost same as before which provide API aka application programming interface like number of social networks by using it numerous developers over the years created custom Twitter clients with amazing features to use extensively.

  

There are many twitter clients which are way better then official one developed by third party developers using API but Twitter and like almost all top social messaging platforms you won't get paid for using it which can be bit dissapointing to users as some people like to use social networks mainly to earn money online 

  

Generally, majority of social networks by default don't pay money for using them so user have to find some other ways to earn money like brand partnerships and sharing advertisements of people and businesses etc but to get this campaigns a user must have huge number of followers on social network handle else no one really partner and pay money for sure, isn't that right?

  

But, the thing is most people don't have huge social networks handle followers they mostly have below 100 followers which is very much not enough to attract businesses to offer advertisers and brand partnerships etc so large percentage of people instead want such social network that for just using it's platform normally pay some money or cool rewards etc.

  

Fortunately, there are some social networks which pay digital fiat currency or rewards to users for simply using their platform which is great but not everyone like and want to earn digital fiat currency or any rewards instead there is certain percentage of people who by using social networks want to earn crypto currency.

  

Crypto currency is basically decentralized digital currency first created and released by anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto in year 2009 named Bitcoin to totally replace fiat paper currency which are not easy to use and mainly unstrustworthy middle mans like banks who take control of user money states to provide security but the thing is banks don't provide transparency due to that you usually won't know how in back end they hande your deposited money.

  

Most banks don't provide transparency so they can't be trusted even if they states to provide top notch security money yet at the end you won't know what type of security system they're using to fully protect your deposited money which is why if you're someone who like and prefer transparency with security and privacy then it's better to use Bitcoin on go.

  

Bitcoin is well known and popular decentralized digital currency considered  as asset which price is volatile depends on buyers and sellers in exchange same as stock market but at first it doesn't have much value mainly because founder want to grow users of Bitcoin organically that worked like charm in just few years Bitcoin got a lot of investors due to that price of Bitcoin eventually reach new heights and become top crypto currency worldwide.

  

Especially, when Bitcoin started getting huge attention and recognition from people around the world with continous increase of investors at that time many developers inspired by Bitcoin developed and released their own crypto currencies like Bitcoin to name few Ethereum, Doge, Polygon Matic but none of them yet beat Bitcoin in popularity and Bitcoin still hold #1 position in crypto market worldwide.

  

The main benefits of Bitcoin is it provides full control and ownership to it's owners as they are stored on hardware or software and custodial wallets which don't require any personal details to use including that transaction are done using proof of stake method where some people using thier computer power will solve blocks of code to verify transactions of Bitcoin then once done those details will be publicly released on blockchain explorer so due to that you'll get transparency, privacy and security.

  

Thankfully, we have many social networks created by third party developers which pay you crypto currencies for using their platform like SubSocial, FriendBuks, Uhive etc but the problem here is most popular social network platforms like for Instance Twitter, Facebook, Reddit and Telegram etc usually don't pay money for using thier platforms, isn't that bit dissapointing?

  

Even though, there are some social networks for Instance TikTok which pay money and rewards like electronic gadgets but only when you reach milestones and don't pay for using their platform or app etc so if you are someone who want to earn Bitcoin for using top social networks like Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Telegram etc then by default it's now not possible.

  

However, if the social network provide an public API then third party developers by using it can develop their own platform of same with many additional options and features in which they can implement such mechanism that pays Bitcoin or any other crypto currencies like Ethereum for using thier platforms, isn't that super cool?

  

Recently, we got to know about an third party client that has numerous amazing options and features named Tweetoshi which pay Bitcoin for using social network Twitter where you can not just deposit and withdraw but also send and receive Bitcoin super fast to fellow twitter users thanks to Bitcoin second layer lightening network that at present widely used globally.

  

Note : Tweetoshi is still in early access beta phase which means development is in progress so you may find some bugs or limited number of features but eventually Tweetoshi may fix all issues and release more interesting and exciting features in future for sure, so do you like it? are you interested? if yes let's explore more.
