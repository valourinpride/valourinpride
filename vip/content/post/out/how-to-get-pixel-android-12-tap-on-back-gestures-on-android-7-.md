We have many search engines to crawl world wide web of internet out of them Google is most popular and favourite choice of millions of users around the world as it's not only fast but also give accurate results using various advanced and powerful technologies.

  

Google previously known as backrub founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in year 1996 at first it was just search engine but later on Google created and acquired many useful projects like Chrome, Gmail, YouTube, Android, Adsense, AdWords etc and all of them are super succesfull due to that with in few years Google become one of the biggest company in the world.

  

Android is an operating system was acquired by Google from Andy Rubens for $50 million in year 2005 back then Google didn't released it publicly but later in order to compete with Apple inc. world's first revolutionary multi-touch technology display smartphone named iPhone they partnered with HTC a Taiwanese mobile company and then released world's first Android powered named HTC Dream.

  

Thankfully, Both iPhone and HTC Dream smartphones can replace keypad mobile phones but iPhone powerful hardware and advanced software named iOS is closed source which means no one else can use thier proprietary hardware and software on smartphones for commercial purposes.

  

Fortunately, Google smartly released Android operating system basically software as an free and open source project which has potential to compete with iOS due to that mobile companies around the world who was unable to use iOS as it's closed source software started build thier own version of Android to load on smartphones then sell globally.

  

Anyhow, HTC Dream aka G1 is beggining of Google smartphone business they eventually partnered with many mobile companies like HTC, LG, Samsung, Sony Motorola etc to make Android powered smartphone series lineup named Nexus until year 2015 after that Google in year 2016 started manufacturing thier own smartphones themselves named Pixel.

  

Pixel is first to get Android software upgrades and updates same as Nexus which provide stock Android with some extra features and apps known as Pixel exclusive features but unfortunately they are fully un-available on non pixel Android smartphones as Google don't include them on AOSP aka Android open source project.

  

Even though, many mobile companies to name few Samsung, Xiaomi, Tecno, etc provides custom Android versions like OneUI, MIUI, HiOS etc which has plenty of extra features which are available in AOSP yet still they don't have few features that're available on Google Pixel smartphones.

  

However, alot of people like to get Pixel based exclusive features on thier Android smartphones which is directly not possible but due to demand some developers build and ported Pixel software and it's features on custom roms like PixelExperience for any Android powered smartphones.

  

But, in order to install customs roms you have to unlock bootloader then install custom recovery like TWRP aka TeamWin recovery project after that you can install Pixel based custom rom if available using guides specifically created for your device from trusted portals like XDA which voids warranty that you may don't like isn't?.

  

Anyhow, in most cases you may don't want to change current software for whatever reasons like you may don't like Pixel stock Android instead you may prefer custom Android versions for you some developers integrated Pixel exclusive features on apps which you can use convieniently.

  

Usually, most apps that provide Pixel exclusive features don't require root access like Privacy Dots but some apps due to system limitations require root access got through Magisk software else it won't work in such case you must root your Android powered smartphone.

  

Recently, we found an interesting and useful free and open source app named Tap, Tap that can provide Google's Pixel exclusive Android 12 tap on back device gestures for any Magisk rooted Android 7.0+ powered smartphones so do you like it? are you interested in Tap, Tap? If yes let's explore more.
