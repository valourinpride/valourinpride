Internet is filled with billions of websites and blogs isn't? If you want to host a web site on world wide wide you need to have powerful enough server that can load your website or blog to visitors from anywhere and anytime in the world so if your server didn't have capacity to handle visitors then your website will go down that's why when you have huge site with millions of visitors you must select server according to it thus you won't face issues in future.

  

Even though, back in 1990s when internet web 1.0 is progressing people used to host thier website or blog on thier computers even now there are few people especially geeks hosting thier sites on computers but that method is bit risky unless you have super computers which is why now a days most people using cloud servers that are more reliable to host and publish thier site on internet easily.

  

However, in order to host your site on cloud servers you need coding skills and knowledge on cloud server hardware and software configuration which you have set according to your site vistors to make your your site work 24/7 but not everyone know about cloud servers and process to setup them which is why newbies who are new¬†

to blogging used to face alot of issues¬† while setting up thier first blog or website.

  

But, In early web 2.0 era many companies started creating content management systems inshort CMS like blogger and WordPress etc which provide simple and easy to use front-end for every one to host thier website on cloud servers as CMS platforms simplified the process to create website or blog people started shifting to cms platforms from cloud servers.

  

There are numerous free and paid CMS platforms on Internet but many people especially newbies don't show interest in buying paid CMS platforms instead they prefer free CMS platforms that usually come with less features and sub domain which is not good for seo and don't look professional as well.

  

Usually, people who are expertised in blogging and big companies choose paid CMS platforms as they come with best features and customer support with option to add custom domain like WordPress VIP even though Blogger has option to add custom domain still there are numerous features missing which are available on paid cms platforms.

  

We have some free cms platforms other then blogger which provide option to add custom domain but they most likely put limits on storage and other features that's why most bloggers don't like free cms platforms instead they prefer to purchase free hosting and then install compatible cms platforms to add custom domain like Infinity free + WordPress etc.

  

Recently, we found an amazing free CMS platform named Groove funnels which is now rebranded as Groove customer support that provide numerous features with unlimited free lifetime hosting and custom domain support in free plan itself isn't awesome? and unlike other platforms you don't need credit card in Groove.

  

Groove.cm has numerous features and templates to create any type of blog or website including that they have several platforms like GrooveMail and GrooveKart etc which you can try for free, so do we got your attention on Groove.cm? are you interested in Groove.cm? If yes be ready to explore more.
