Do you frequently keep in touch with your family? If yes then most probably you may be using your favourite social messaging app like whatsapp, signal etc to chat or call right? but most social messaging apps do not provide you personal private space which means anybody with your phone number can message you without your permission that can disturb or cause trouble when you only insist to chat with your family in private without distractions.

  

So, if you just want to stay in touch with family then you need specific messaging app which will provide personal private space for your family to communicate and share personal moments of your life, but as we said earlier most messaging app do not provide personal private space for family which is definitely a drawback.

  

However, in this scenario we are glad to announce we have a workaround we found a messaging app named Momatu that is 100% specially designed for family to chat & share your personal moments securely and privately without limitations, to be exact Momatu is like a virtual home for your family, so do we got your attention on Momatu? are your interested in Momatu?
