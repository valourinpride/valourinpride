When Apple inc. founder Steve Jobs didn't launched multi-touch display technology powerful hardware and advanced software smartphone named iPhone on January 9, 2007 prior that majority of people around the world used to depend on retro keypad mobile phones from many companies out of them Nokia is top choice.

  

Fortunately, after iPhone success alot of mobile companies around the world started making thier own smartphones like iPhone due to that with in few years most 

people shifted to smartphones as they provide better and modern features which have potential and capability to totally replace keypad mobile phones globally.

  

In 21st century, almost everyone using smartphones out of them there are small percentage people want to use keypad mobile phones for Nostalgia reasons but they can't as keypad mobile phones are outdated especially old ones don't have latest features of smartphones which are important to manage life efficiently today.

  

Anyhow, majority of people have nostalgia for Nokia keypad mobile phones as back then in early 2000s it was one of the world's largest keypad mobile phone manufacturer so there is high probability that you want to use Nokia keypad mobile again if you do but can't due to whatever reasons mainly because of unavailability and dependency on smartphones, isn't?

  

Even though, we have many digital online shopping platforms which sell some old Nokia keypad mobile phones but alot of old Nokia keypad mobile phones are unavailable as Nokia stopped making them since long time even the available ones are pretty expensive for the same price you'll now get flagship smartphones.

  

There are many people who buy old Nokia keypad mobile phones even if they're expensive for nostalgia reasons to re-experience hardware of software but most of them don't as they feel it's not worth money instead they want to feel vibes of Nokia keypad mobile phones on modern smartphones which is not possible.

  

On smartphones, you can't directly get Nokia keypad mobile phones hardware and software as it's not compatible but few third party developers able to develop emulators like J2ME Loader, EKA2L1 by using them you can run keypad mobile phone operating systems like Java and SymbianOS apps on smartphones.

  

However, even if emulators can run keypad mobile phones operating system apps on smartphones yet most of them don't provide exact look and feel of keypad mobile phones in order to get them either emulator developer have to re-design UI or your smartphone makers have to theme operating system which is possible but they won't do due to lack of demand and mainly because of commercial reasons.

  

Thankfully, now more then 75% smartphones run search engine giant Google Android operating system as it's free and open source which compete with iPhone closed source operating system iOS edge to edge in every sector but in terms of software customization Android has more features over iPhone iOS.

  

In sense, Android is free ecosystem that  provides alot of extensive software customization features which are unavailable on iOS like you can install third party launchers, widgets and live wallpapers that's why most people use and Android powered smartphones.

  

Recently, we found 3 themes of Nokia keypad mobile phones which you can setup on Android using KWLP and Nova launcher to get look and feel of Nokia keypad mobile phone on smartphones but keep in mind it's just live wallpaper with ability to interact with user touch inputs so don't expect it to be full replacement of keypad mobile phones.

  

Note : once you setup Nokia keypad mobile phone themes using KWLP it can only open smartphone apps not keypad mobile phone operating systems apps as it's not emulator so it's suitable for those who just want look and feel of keypad mobile phones yet don't want to miss out smartphones, so do you like it? are you interested? If yes let's explore more.
