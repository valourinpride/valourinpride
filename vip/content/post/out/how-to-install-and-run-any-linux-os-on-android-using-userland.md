Computer is a hardware device made up of numerous technologies to run a operating system that was a software developed using various programming languages currently there are two types of operating systems Terminal and GUI aka Graphical User Interface that you can access on computer and do alot of real life works electronically or digitally using different additional softwares supported by operating system which you can install and run inside a operating system it's like software inside software.

  

Even though, now most people are shifted to smartphones as it can do almost all works of computers in it's own using its own mobile operating systems yet smartphones are sealed which means if you're not a technician you can't remove or add additional hardware parts on smartphones and unfortunately smartphones don't provide a slot to increase storage and memory etc thus smartphones are less powerful and advanced then computers.

  

The world's first Computer difference Engine is invented by Charles Babbage in 1820s since then many scientists and companies developed various types of computers and then updated and upgraded with new technologies to get new features according to requirements at that time due to that computers eventually become more advanced and powerful and went to a phase where we can operating system on computers.

  

However, at first computers are very big and expensive thus common people can't afford them easily which is why back in early 19th century only companies used them like IBM but as time passes number of scientists, entrepreneurs and huge companies worked for years even decades to reduce the size and price of computers to make them affordable and fit anywhere in your homes on your lap or small table thanks to them by the end of 19th century we got super advanced and powerful PCs aka personal computers.

  

We have numerous terminal and GUI operating systems for PCs now most people only use GUI based PC also knowns as desktop operating systems like Windows and MacOS but there are many people who like and prefer Terminal operating systems especially developers and coders for them Linux is favourite operating that you can simply install on Terminal to run instantly.

  

Linux is created by early 1990s by Finnish software engineer Linus Torvalds which is an open source operating system thus anyone in the world can contribute to fix bugs and improve Linux due to that Linux gone through alot of required updates and upgrades over the years to become much better then before to let you install and run on your PCs smoothly and properly.

  

Thankfully, many developers around the world developed numerous distributions of Linux it's like custom operating systems which may have several changes to decrease or increase features etc for various purposes according to usage patterns of people which you can simply download and install directly or run on a virtual machine like VMWare on your PC.

personal computers.

  

But, some people are unable to afford PC or they don't like to use it for whatever reason if you want to direct install and run Linux distributions on smartphones that's  not possible due to incompatibility as most Linux distributions are specifically made to run only on PCs yet there is few ways to run Linux operating systems on smartphones using PC emulators,cloud servers and remote desktop apps etc.

  

We have some emulators to run Linux or any other operating systems on smartphone but they require you have to alot some memory to run operating systems that may slow down your smartphone even though there are numerous platforms to install and run PC operating systems on browsers yet they most likely ask you to enter personal details to create account it can loose you anonymity while most cloud servers are expensive to run which is why most people now using remote desktop apps to run PC operating systems on smartphone.

  

Remote desktop software or apps in-fact used to mirror PC operating system on smartphone but fortunately we have some apps on smartphones build by talented developers by using them you can simply download and install Linux or any other operating on smartphone then directly run on Remote desktop apps of smartphone.

  

Recently, we found a amazing app open source app named UserLAnd that also has build in terminal where you can easily install and run several Terminal and GUI based linux distributions, desktop FireFox browser, desktop softwares and games etc on smartphone then it will auto and connect on VNC viewer isn't cool? so do you like it? are you interested in UserLAnd?
