Technology, changed every aspect of mankind and simplified almost all works in numerous ways to such extent people now in 21th century can do most physical stuff from indoor spaces using tech gadgets for ex: In olden days people around the world used to play physical games but later on in year 1972 when world's first home gaming console The Odyssey manufactured and  released by Magnavox since then people started playing home console games.

  

Home gaming consoles are very similar to computers where you will get single digital screen and some pre-installed games that are known as video games with an option to add additional video games using any compatible external card and then once you setup home gaming console you can start playing video games via supported gamepad that works like keyboard but varies in design and structure.

  

There are numerous home gaming consoles manufactured and released by different companies over the years and each home gaming consoles and thier models has it's own design and format games thus you can't play one home console video game on another due to different hardware and software with number of system limitations.

  

However, only few companies like Nintendo and Sony got immense success and popularity with thier home gaming consoles especially Nintendo developed and released many home gaming consoles since 1983 that are better then existing ones with upgraded system and games thus alot gamers like to play video games on Nintendo home gaming consoles.

  

Nintendo is one of the top and leading home gaming console maker who did alot of experiments on thier home video game consoles to develop much better home gaming consoles like for instance people got used to 2D video games but in 1987 Nintendo released world's first 3D video gaming consoles including that they even created dual screen home gaming console in year 2004 named Nintendo DS.

  

But, when modern personal computers inshort PC and smartphones released in electronics market the sells and usage of home gaming consoles dropped as people around the world shifted to modern PCs or smartphones that have powerful hardware and advanced softwares to install and play high graphic intensive games.

  

Even though, PCs and smartphones has millions of games and much more capable and comfortable then home gaming consoles yet many gamers still like to play home console video gamers for Nostalgia reasons but in order to play video games you need to buy home gaming consoles which are expensive and not worthy as in this digital technology era you can now play almost all home console video games on PCs or smartphones using emulators.

  

Emulators are build by third party developers who are not associated with home gaming console makers thus they are unofficial so third party developers won't get any support due to that they have to go through alot of things in order to make PC or smartphone hardware and software compatibile emulator that is hard and takes time which is why most video game emulators stay at early access or beta phase for years even being open source projects on GitHub or GitLab etc.

  

We have many stable unofficial emulators available for PCs as it's have powerful hardware like home gaming console so you can play any video games without lag and glitches on PCs but on smartphones you can't play video games in full fps rate like PC because of hardware and software limitations.

  

Fortunately, modern smartphones has powerful hardware and software by using them you can do almost all works of PC in it's own way so most people eventually shifted to user-friendly smartphones and then they starting demanding video game emulators for smartphones thus from past decade we got many unofficial PC video game emulators on smartphones like Citra 3DS, Dolphin etc.

  

Recently, we found an free and open source unofficial emulator named melonDS build by Rafael V. Caetano to play Nintendo DS video games on smartphones which is unofficial port of melonDS PC video game emulator that officially don't support smartphones as of now, so do we got your attention? are you ready to explore?
