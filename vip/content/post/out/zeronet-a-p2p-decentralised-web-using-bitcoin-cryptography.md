In order to publish your website on internet you need unique domain & reliable hosting platform, fortunately we have both paid and free domain and hosting platforms available out there on world wide web like blogger, wordpress, weebly, wix etc with it's own advantages and dis-advantages, 

  

Majority of bloggers and website creators preffering and using paid domain and hosting platforms for proffesional look, SEO and brand marketing purposes, how ever there are even some drawbacks on paid domain and hosting platforms like even though most domain and hosting platforms says 99% security and uptime but there is no guarantee because your website is hosted on thier servers.

  

While, some bloggers host thier websites on thier PC which is way more risky because a small mistake on your computer can end up with un-recoverable data losses, this is why people who care about security and uptime of thier website has to rely on something else other then domain and hosting platforms to be in safe and future proof zone.

  

In this scenario, we like to present a open source peer to peer de-centralised network named ZeroNet founded by Tamas Kocsis in 2015 where you can create or add your website for free, ZeroNet uses bitcoin cryptography and bit-torrent to serve website to users as there is no central server, visitors will host the website for each other due to this there is no hosting charges & websites will always accessible with no single failure anytime.

  

ZeroNet require no configuration, no passwords you just have to download and start using it once you setup and create ZeroNet decentralised website using namecoin cryptography you will get .BIT domains including that ZeroNet only support modern browser on windows, linux, mac, and Android platform with ZeroNet client.

  

ZeroNet is under-rated futuristic technology which didn't received enough attention from people around the world, so due to this we have very few clients available for Android to access ZeroNet, how ever from past few years we got to see some ZeroNet clients on mobile out of them we found one best ZeroNet client that we are going to explore.
