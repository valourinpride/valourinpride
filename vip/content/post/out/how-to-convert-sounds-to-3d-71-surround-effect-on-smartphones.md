3D, 8D, 7.1 surround sound have you ever heard about them? If you're here then you probably do isn't it? but for those who don't before we get into topic let's in simple get the basics right thus you'll appreciate 3D, 8D, 7.1 surround sounds more, as you may know there are two types of sounds since long time that we listened on headphones which are mono and stereo but the thing is over the years they become pretty common so a lot of people wanted new and better experience sound listening experience at the time we got 3D, 8D, 7.1 surround sound formats which are revolutionary and super cool.

  

Mono is one channel so whatever sound came from electronic device through in ear headphones or its evolutions like earphones and earbuds in both sides will be same and then when it comes to stereo it is dual channel so in one side you can listen something like flute and in another side can listen to chorus it's better isn't it? to make sound listening experience even better we got 3D that let you listen sound in all the directions like 360° thus you'll get true realistic sound experience on go.

  

When it comes to 8D that you may have seen in many video blogging platforms like YouTube when you play 8D sound it will move from left to right and vice versa created using a technique known as binaural panning which is pretty cool but in the end it is stereo and basically gimmick yet bit similar to 3D sound but yeah if you want true realistic sound experience then it's better to go with 3D sound which at present available on few sound engines like DTS and Sony Dolby Atmos etc.

  

Even though, 3D sound is already revolutionary but there is one more amazing technology named surround sound that now many people around the world specifically use in public and home theatres which let you listen sound from 4 direction so considering that 3D sound is way better for sure but some people may like and prefer surround sound over 3D audio and vice versa which is why it's better to have both of them on electronic devices like speakers and smartphones to get rich sound experience fabulously.

  

Usually, you mainly find 3D and surround sound on speakers but from last decade number of smartphone companies in partnership with sound companies like DTS and Sony Integrating 3D sound technologies like 3D and surround sound on number of electronic devices other then home and theatre speakers like smart TVs and smartphones etc isn't that cool? 

  

However, majority of makers don't Integrate and provide sound engines on low and mid range smartphones which are mostly available on expensive ones even in high price segment smartphones many makers don't add sound engines, if your smartphone don't have inbuild sound engine then you usually have to unlock bootloader and flash custom recoveries like TWRP then root using Magisk after that you can install custom ported sound engines on your smartphones but doing  this process voids device warranty.

  

Especially, If you are someone who don't know basic technical terms of software and hardware of smartphone then it's better to not unlock bootloader and root device as if you do anything wrong then it soft or hardbrick your smartphone which is sometimes irreparable that's one of the primary reason why many people limit themselves to no root smartphones.

  

Do you have smartphone with no in-built sound engine and don't want to root for whatever reasons yet want to experience 3D and surround sound then there is one method in that you can't automatically play regular audio in 3D as there is no sound engines in root level instead you have to 

manually convert regular audio files into 3D sounds for that we have numerous platforms but before we cover them have you ever heard of 3D surround radio?  

  

Generally, radio is wireless communication technologies that was eventually got used to broadcast content of newspapers and public shows then later on number of individuals and companies begin setting up radio stations around the world in both local as well as urban areas then started broadcasting musics playlists, back then they can be only listened on radio players but now radio technologies are Integrated on smartphones and iPods etc.

  

Usually, FM aka frequency modulation radio stations that we can tune on smartphones mostly play sound in either mono or stereo mode, as said earlier it is no special now, what if we can listen to radio in 3D or surround effect it will be amazing right? It is possible without root a developer named Tamal Basak developed a app which has big list of radio stations available around the world and plays them in 3D and surround sounds amazingly.

  

Tamal Basak not just created 3D and surround sound radio but also developed another app where you can convert regular audio files into 8D basically 3D, both are equipped with numerous useful options and features which you can adjust as per you liking and preferences to make your music listening experience awesome.

  

Note : the 3D music and radio players developed are still in early access phase which means development is in progress so you may find bugs or limited number of features but eventually 3D music and radio players fix all issues and release more interesting and exciting features in future, so do you like it? are you interested in 3D players, If yes then let's explore more.
