 **[![Tooter - India's swadeshi micro-blogging platform alternative to Twitter!](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-WndozVJc9Ro/YLZ2omBjeVI/AAAAAAAAEu0/v4YSuPELDzITQXBUxXPNQjnGlJks6Es-wCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/1622570655804058-0.png "Tooter - India's swadeshi micro-blogging platform alternative to Twitter!")](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-WndozVJc9Ro/YLZ2omBjeVI/AAAAAAAAEu0/v4YSuPELDzITQXBUxXPNQjnGlJks6Es-wCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/1622570655804058-0.png)** 

**Twitter** is un-doubtedly the most popular and well build micro-blogging platform it has millions of users in **India & Overseas** they even accepted to comply with India new IT rules on **June 01** but there will be some negative impacts on desi apps for sure as we know after TikTok ban Indian companies utilised this opportunity and created apps like **TikTok** and grown thier companies userbase and get profits that will increase nation **economy** and spike the potential of **India developers**. 

  

If Indian developers have the potential to make an alternative for **TikTok** then there is also possibility to create an alternative for **Twitter** like when **PUBG** banned Indian developers unleashed thier creative skills and talent by creating alternative to pubg like **faug, sico** and more which received a tremendous support from **Indian people**. 

  

**Yes**, banning apps some way unleasing Indian companies & developers **talent** & **potential** including that **aatma nirbhar** is also one of the reason behind this huge improvement in digital software sector this program launched by **PM Modi** will motivate and provide financial support to Indian developers who create **quality** & **world** **class** apps. 

  

**So**, If India change the public economy to **closed economy** by creating polices very similar to **china** which will restrict foreign investment and supervise or control the technology transfer that will improvise and increase technology, **self reliance**, **home** **grown** **inventions** and **economy** for sure.

  

**But**, India changing its policies similar to China is **possible** either it will change Or not there is high **chance** India change its policies similar to China considering the success of **aatma nirbhar bharat** but do note that take our estimation as grain of salt it may happen or not, if that happens india will become more **self reliant.** 

  

**However**, Indian people like to support & use **swadeshi** products either software or real like they supported india's alternative to twitter named **koo** or TikTok alternative and pubg alternative indians like and love to support & use swadeshi stuff if there is **quality** and that **worth money**, so if Twitter will be available in India or not in future by our **analysis** on the frequent changes in IT policies of India that are created to protect **national sovereignty** and **security**. 

  

**Eventhough,** Twitter is india's most **loved** micro-blogging & social network website used by millions of people and celebraties to share thier **opinion** or support & create **trends** but if you like to support India apps or websites to help **Indian developers** and companies that will increase our **economy** then you will surely need an **Indian made** products, apps, websites or services. 

  

**In this scenario**, if you want best alternative to Twitter we have two micro-blogging websites made by Indian developers named named **koo & tooter** while koo is app there is no web version available right now but In **Tooter **it has web version that will make you feel like you are using original **Twitter** website **so,** you can consider Tooter as an reliable Twitter alternative, do we got your interest if yes let's know little more Information on Tooter & start joining on it.
