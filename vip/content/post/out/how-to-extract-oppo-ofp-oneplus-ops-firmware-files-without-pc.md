Device, as you may know in this modern world we use different types of devices like PCs, smartphones and smartwatches etc in our daily life to do various types of tasks which are basically electronic ones usually in small size integrated with latest technologies made for specific purposes at first devices used to be electronic but eventually thanks to many companies who integrated digital technologies like OS aka operating systems, application softwares etc to do tasks digitally quite easily at the end electronic or digital devices are pretty amazing revolutionary technologies they'll work like wonder and become very useful when integrated together to do something you want electronically or digitally on the go effectively and efficiently, isn't it?

  

Since long time like from mid 90s itself  people started experimenting on making variety of digital technologies and then connect them to electronic devices in that process we now got modern powerful and advanced electronic devices at first digital technologies are not visible but eventually thanks to many inventors who continously upgraded and updated the electronic and digital technologies to improve and make them better in that process we eventually got number of visible digital technologies like CLI aka command line interface and 

GUI aka graphical user interface which all let you use electronic devices comfortably and conveniently including that as you will be able to see them on the screen by using them you can do most tasks extensively.

  

Usually, in order to make an device if necessary or essential we use and combine number of digital technologies on electronic devices and vice versa as per needs accordingly but they must be right and integrated well to make functionalities work well which most companies usually do as they spend so much money to do a lot of R&D aka research and development and then they strive and try as much as possible to develop and get whichever required technologies to organize them in one and build packed worthy devices but thing is sometimes on certain devices there's chance you may find electronic or digital technologies are not integrated or organized correctly due to that you may face hard time in understanding or using them if you don't there's chance that your device may surely will, don't you think?

  

In sense, we need number of different electronic or digital parts to make one device and in most cases they must be integrated and organized well properly else you or device may find problems in accessing or utilizing functionalities when it to comes to electronic devices as you may most probably know it's basically a hardware product build up of numerous electronic parts and when it comes to digital technologies they are softwares created using number of programming languages like C, C++, Ruby, Python etc which all are interconnected and work in their limits and capacity to bring what you want or show in it's system aka ecosystem that's why even if one part damaged or file corrupted or missed it can get device into many troubles, so deal things carefully.

  

Eventhough, most makers usually test hardware and debug software to fix bugs and improve things in that process they keep on integrating and organizing things whenever possible but thing is sometimes some makers even to do quite simple ones take long time for instance search engine giant Google developed and released an foss aka free and open source operating system named Android back in year 2009 on HTC Dream after that as it's foss many developers and companies using source code from AOSP aka Android open source project build firmware and custom roms for their smartphones which is good but for more then one decade certain system files of Android are scattered in different folders of firmware due to that device not able to process them easily even if it does just one file miss or corrupt can make the system go down and hard to revive back.

  

If you don't know what exactly is firmware then for you in simple firmware is basically software that provide such drivers which make software and hardware compatible though it's usually below 100 mb aka mega byte size but stock firmware that you get on Android smartphones will be around GBs aka giga bytes it includes software and firmware in one package archived in .zip or .rar format etc in that there will be many system files scattered in different folders including that vendor and product image is included in system thought most devices can understand and process them but why to make it complex if we keep them simple for device like by organizing or integrating files it will be fast and easy for devices right? that's why back in year 2018 for Android 8.0 oreo and 9.0 pie Google released Project Treble.

  

Thankfully, In Project Treble Google introduced GSI aka generic system image which is basically pure implementation of Android due to that almost all Treble supported devices can run the latest Android versions even if device makers don't provide them including that certain system partitions like product and vendor on old Android 7.0 and before versions used to be included in system but from Project Treble they were seperated and organized and then packed in super.img known as dynamic partitions due to that device becomes flexible as that supports A/B partitions with ability to auto switch whenever necessary and you or system to update device or fix can simply modify or change, replace not working or corrupted partitions to get back on Android thanks to

such advantages of dynamic partions a lot of makers adding it on their devices with super.img for the welfare of everyone.

  

However, some device makers thought provide support for dynamic partitions but for whatever reason don't use super.img even though super.img works pretty well which can be opened or extracted using any latest file manager instead some device makers like for instance Xiaomi utilize payload.bin which is basically copy of super.img but can't be extracted using file manager for that you have to use a script on terminal including that there are many other copies of super.img when it comes to realme, oppo they use .ofp file in order to extract we can use MCT .ofp bypass software and when it comes to OnePlus .ops in order to extract we have to use script on terminal but thing is to do all this things most people say we need PC right? but actually you can extract payload, .ofp and .ops using smartphone itself all you need is Termux which is like CMD for Android devices, so do you like it? are you interested? If yes let's explore more.

\- It will start decrypting .ops, ofp files.

  

That's it, you successfully decrypted .ops, .ofp files using Termux.

  

Atlast, this are just highlighted features of .ofp and .ops decrypter and Termux there may be many hidden features in-build that provides you external benefits to give the ultimate usage experience, anyway if you want one of the best .ofp and .ops decrypter then this one by bkerler seems like at present on go worthy choice.

  

Overall, Termux comes with dark mode by default, it has clean and simple user interface that ensures user friendly experience, but in any project there is always space for improvement so let's wait and see will Termux get any major UI changes in future to make it even more better, as of now of it's pretty nice.

  

Moreover, it's definitely worth to mention Android payload dumper by vm03 is one of the few .ofp and .ops decrypter available for Android available out there on worldwide web of internet to extract system images from .ofp and .ops decrypter, yes indeed if you're searching for such .ofp and .ops decrypter then this one may become your new favorite.

  

Finally, this is how you can extract system image files from .ofp and .ops decrypter, are you an existing user of bkerler .ofp and .ops decrypter If yes do say your experience and mention if there is any better .ofp and .ops decrypter in our comment section below, see ya :)
