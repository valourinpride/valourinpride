In this era of digital technology, you no more have to rely on old and traditional communication ways as now we are in modern era of digital technology where electronic gadgets and technologies like computers, smartphones and softwares rule the world which can connect people and do most real life tasks digitally online.

  

There are numerous technologies that allows you to communicate with anyone globally using personal computers and smartphones at first people used Email a software to send and receive mails started in early 1960s which is also widely used now but later on people around the world by using various technologies made revolutionary communication platforms which eventually become best alternatives to Email.

  

Especially, in year 1991 Tim Berners Lee released www aka world wide web a browser to access internet since then it got huge recognition due to that alot of people started building digital platforms like websites and blogs etc using various programming languages and technologies to deploy on internet in that process Andrew Weinreich in year 1997 launched [sixdegrees.com](http://sixdegrees.com) website which is considered as world's first social media platform.

  

Fortunately, many companies and developers around the world over the years continuously build and improved social media platforms due to that we got modern social messaging apps where you'll get alot of options and features by using them you can not just send text messages but also make group voice calls and video calls easily and comfortably.

  

We have numerous modern social media platforms which are also known as social messaging platforms out of them Telegram is one of the most popular and top social messaging platform developed by VKontakte founders Pavel durov and Nikolai durov initially released in year 2013

that focuses on privacy and security.

  

Telegram comes with powerful and advanced features that are unavailable on majority of social messaging platforms like you can delete chat history in both ends including that if you want more privacy and security then you can simply start a secret chat with self destructible timer where no one can take screenshot or record your chat history and it will be automatically deleted at specified time leaving no traces on Telegram servers.

  

The main advantage of Telegram is you can create number of public and private channels to broadcast content and groups to chat with teams or community of upto 200,000 members for each one including that you can send upto 2GB file size on free plan and 4GB file size on premium plan thus it's very suitable and preffered choice for small and big creators.

  

Recently, Telegram launched premium plan on June 10 by subscribing to that users will get doubles benefits with no ads but for most users free plan is enough unless you want fast download speed, additional stickers, reactions, voice to text conversation, profile badge, app icons, advanced chat management etc.

  

Anyhow, Most people come to Telegram to use bots there are two types of Telegram, official bots are created by Telegram and unofficial bots are build by third party developers using Telegram Public API we have thousands of official and unofficial bots of almost all categories on Telegram which can do alot of works even manage all your Telegram channels and groups automatically, isn't amazing?

  

Meanwhile, majority of social messaging platforms has no bots in first place and don't provide an option to full delete chat history in both ends and they have many limitations like you can only have upto 500 max members in group and channel so if you have large communities then in order to maintain them you have to create numerous channels and groups on them that is hard and consume time in-addition you can only send files of upto 100 MB size that was further reduced  based on format of file like for images file size is just 8MB that's disappointing isn't? 

  

Thankfully, Telegram with it's futuristic features able to gain millions of users over the years and most of them are shifted from other social messaging platforms like WhatsApp, due to increasing users Telegram that known for regular updates speed up it's development to provide much better and exciting features faster then before.

  

Even though, There are plenty features on Telegram and they constantly working to add more like always they constantly working to add more but still right now  some features that required by Telegram users so to provide them some third party developers build many Telegram unofficial forks like exteraGram, Forkgram, Owlgram etc to provide features that are unavailable on official Telegram.

  

But, almost all Telegram unofficial forks comply with Telegram terms of service and policies due to that you'll get same limitations to name a few you can't add more then 3+ accounts and on private channels you can't download or forward files as they're are restricted to protect content from unauthorised sharing and misuages etc that's fine.

  

However, Telegram is not fully open source so many people consider that it  won't provide full privacy and security and large percentage of users want to bypass limitations of official Telegram for them and himself a third party developer named nikitasius build ultimate fork of Telegram named Telegraher.

  

Telegraher is based on official repo of official Telegram but customized and modified it to provide useful and awesome extra features that totally breaks TOS and policies like to name a few you can add 3+

accounts, download forward restricted files any private groups and channels etc so do you like it? are you interested in Telegraher? If yes let's explore more.
