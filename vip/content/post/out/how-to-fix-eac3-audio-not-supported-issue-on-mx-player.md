Overall, It is very easy to add Custom codec on MX player due to simple and clean interface that give user friendly experience, even though new MX player bloated with alot of OTT features but still adding custom codecs is pretty easy, but in any project there is always space for improvement so I hope MX player will provide custom codecs in app itself so people can download or uninstall easily whenever they insist with security, instead roaming for custom codecs on internet.

  

Moreover, it is definitely worth to mention MX player is one of the very few video player apps which support custom codecs, and as earlier said MX player support many codecs and all of them work flawless without issues, yes indeed if you're searching for such video player app then MX player is worthy choice but if you don't like MX player india's OTT stuff then you may choose other video player else you can ignore OTT stuff and just focus on MX video player to get joyful experience.

  

Finally, this is how you can fix EAC3 audio not supported issue on MX player using 

all in one custom codec ARMv8 1.14.2 zip, in are you an existing user of this custom code zip? If yes do say your experience with it and mention have you ever used any other custom codec other then this on MX player in our comment section below,  see ya :)
