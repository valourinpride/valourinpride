While there is two variants of display one black and white display and later a inventor worked and presented to the world a colour tv with a lot of struggle.

  

However, let's get into point where television tv used antennas to get them working with alot of big monitors to handle the screen time goes CRT televisions become smaller and smaller day by day.

  

Let's get into the point of colour tvs it's the era Hollywood golden age of films when people want the experience in colours while it was only limited to big screens through projection.

  

While it's not a easy task while there is alot of workaround to get a workting prototype of colour television at the time and it's a big step towards later advancements in televisions and related fields.

  

It's was the time where the movies and news and some channels are working and telecasting in black & white mode then the whole focus has been switched to colour television for company's and public it does maid aloud of talk in limited advertising through people,Â 

  

However not everyone able to buy the television and it's to expensive even after the decades of beginning stage it's not only limited to b&w TV's but for the colour tvs to.

  

In electronic or any other field when there is competition and people required to get into every person's home companies and competitors try to do thier best to get the products at a lower price than the competitor pricing and the techniques and advancements has been rapid in field of television and thiers a big competition takes into place within the most popular conglomerate currently like sony, samsung , akai and bplÂ 

  

There are different patents for different companies while the strategies and working structure and technology difference makes the companies vary between them and thier way of approach to public.

  

Now to understand better regarding television let's now limited to b&w and colour television's

Television do work on three colours like red, green and white to reproduce digital image into electronic systems at the time getting various things through digital signals into the monitor via different different lanes to reproduce sound etc.
