Computers also known as desktops existed for decades and there were the only technology devices for mankind thus since the first computer difference engine created by Charles Babbage in 14th June, 1922 computers gone through number of advancements from geeks, techies and companies around the world.

  

Most people don't know that computers used to be very big and not everyone can afford them in early days but eventually as time goes companies managed to develop home compatible small size computers at affordable prices for personal usages that are known as personal computers aka PC like MIT's The Altair and Apple Mac etc.

  

The entry of personal computers in electronics market changed and simplified the way countries and people work together as by using them you can do almost all physical works digitally on computers like drawing, writing, create, documents, analyse data etc using powerful and advanced softwares.

  

However, the market share and popularity of personal computers further Increased in year 1991 onwards when Tim Berners Lee released revolutionary technology internet web 1.0 that changed world and opened plethora of digital technologies and services thus people out of curiosity buyed personal computers just to check internet and that technology now become essential and necessary for almost all countries.

  

The impact of internet on people is enormous since then people started working using internet and computers at the same time to complete work faster then before but as people can only access internet on computers they have to stay at computers for long hours in indoor spaces thus they are not even getting enough time for physical activities for example : when computers are not available people used to play outdoor physical games which are now replaced with indoor digital games available on computers.

  

Every contribution and invention for the development of computers done over the years especially in 19th century and 20th immensely helped to upgrade computers software and hardware, right now in 21st century of Millennials and Gen-Z we have modern computers that comes with giga bytes of powerful memory, storage, CPU, GPU which can handle any task in ease.

  

If you're familiar with old computers then you probably know they used to get basic CPU and GPU chipset that are powerful at that time yet only capable of playing basic 2D games but now we have super modern computers that are more capable then old computers by using them you can play big size and heavy resources high graphic intensive games.

  

But, in 2007 Apple founder Steve jobs launched iPhone 1 a revolutionary multi-touch display mobile included with very powerful hardware and softwares that are way more capable then basic keypad phones at that time thus majority of people around the world just amazed and exicited to buy iPhone 1 as soon as they can.

  

The high demand of iPhone 1 heavily reduced sells of keypad mobiles thus mobile companies has no choice other then start making plans to make iPhone type mobiles as soon as possible to stay  in mobile market which they eventually did even search engine giant with in 1 year Google partnered with HTC to make thier own mobiles.  

  

Mobiles equipped with multi-touch technology and advanced features known as smartphones, even though majority of smartphones are inspired and similar to iPhone yet as Apple iPhone hardware and mobile operating system " iOS " is closed source no one access and use them thus mobiles companies used other alternative hardware and mobile operating systems.

  

Most smartphones are powered by Google's free and open source mobile operating " Android " which is considered as best alternative to Apple's iOS that has 71% of world wide mobile OS market share but as Android is open source you will get bit less security when compared with closed mobile operating syatem of Apple's iOS 

  

Fortunately, smartphones are small in size and from past one decade gone through rapid developments due to that now we have powerful hardware and advanced software smartphones that can do almost all works of computers in it's own way but still you can't run computers softwares on smartphones due to different hardware and software with system limitations.

  

People very much thought it's impossible to run computer softwares on smartphones but thankfully developers managed to develop emulators like Limbo and ExaGear etc by using them you can install limited number of computer operating systems and softwares on smartphones that's why majority of people don't like to use emulators instead they prefer real computers.

  

Especially, you can't run high graphic heavy resources big file size computer games on smartphones using Limbo or ExaGear Emulator as you won't be able to install them in first place but luckily you can install some old computer games and softwares on Limbo or ExaGear Emulator.

  

Emulator are created by third party developers who are not associated with companies thus they are considered as unofficial so they usually don't get any support due to that third party developers need to work super hard and go through alot of things to build smartphone hardware and software compatible emulator that takes time which is why most emulators stay at early access or beta phase for years even being open source projects on GitHub or GitLab etc.

  

Companies usually don't make emulators to install and run computer softwares on smartphones as it will decrease sells of their existing computers so unofficial emulators are made without permission from companies thus it's illegal to use as they are made without permission beside 

that have to first download pirated version of computer operating system and then load softwares on computer emulator.  

  

Anyhow, we recently found a method to install and run most popular old computer games IGI 2 Covert Strike a multi-player tactical shooter fps game successor of IGI 1 developed by innerloop studio and released by code masters on smartphones using ExaGear Emulator, so do you like it? are you interested? If yes let's know little more info before we get started.
