Discord, a popular social messaging platform especially among gamers around the world which though used by almost all communities but mostly and widely used  by gaming community thanks to numerous amazing options and features which work absolutely pretty well for digital gamers to communicate with teams via text chat or make voice and video based calls etc to discuss on different aspects of gaming quite conveniently and comfortably.

  

In fact, there are many cool social messaging platforms alternative to Discord like Telegram that is very similar to Discord and has almost all options and features with big file size limit like 4GB which is not available on Discord yet still most gamers of almost all categories from PCs to smartphones and video games etc right on go with Discord mainly due to it's well designed layout and functionalities which work for gaming communities.

  

In sense, now a days majority of gamers globally using Discord to maintain gaming communities though they since long time telegram giving edge to edge competition to Discord in almost all aspects and in recent updates Telegram begin providing layout similar to Discord for its users to better organize and maintain groups and channels of not just gaming but also for other communities, isn't that cool?

  

Even though, Telegram in number of matters is much better then Discord for instance to name few as telegram is open source it's code is public that provide way more assurance of privacy and security at the same time telegram source code and API - application programming interface can be used by anyone to make their own unofficial custom telegram clients which is unfortunately not possible on Discord.

  

The reason why developers can't make their own unofficial client of Discord is because it's not open source including that Discord doesn't allow it's users to use unofficial clients of Discord which were created by third party developers by doing offline modifications to official Discord if found Discord account can be deactivated temporarily or permanently yet still almost all gamers prefer to use Discord as they got used to it, are you one of them?

  

However, unofficial clients of any app provides additional options and features likewise we get the same on unofficial Discord clients as well like BetterDiscord, Replugged+, Aliucord, Enmity etc where you'll get numerous external stuff even you can apply custom themes isn't that cool? which at the end definitely provide missing functionalities of Discord and even may not let the users shift to Telegram.

  

But, even the official version of Discord thought lack functionalities when compared to unofficial ones but there are certain functionalities that are not available on Telegram like for Instance rich presense that if configured and setup correctly can automatically update your currently live status on your discord profile like playing a video game or using a app what not you can add everything.

  

Usually, most discord rich presense managers are available for PCs created by third party developers using open source rich presense from rich presence manager from Discord and using the same you can create your own discord rich presence manager app if you don't want to use someone that require some coding but there are few free and open source discord rich presence manager for smartphones.

  

Generally, majority of people use Discord on smartphones over web and PCs including that from past last decade large percentage of people using apps and playing games including arcade machine and home console video games on smartphones as they can do almost all tasks of PC in it's own way way which is why demand for Discord rich presence mangers for smartphones mainly from gamers increased immensely.
