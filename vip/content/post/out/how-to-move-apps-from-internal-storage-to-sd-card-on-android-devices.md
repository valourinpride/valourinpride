Storage is basically term denoted for certain free space in area or container in which you can store whatever things you want as long as free space available like not totally occupied and full which is of 2  types physical and electronic storage both are widely used worldwide when it comes to physical we store material objects and then in electronic one we store digital files like audio, video, documents etc in various different structures and formats like .mp4, .hevc, .mkv, .pdf, .jpg  etc at the end each and every material and digital thing based on it's capacity and technology usually has it's own shape and size so always better to get big storage space as high as possible according to needs so that you will be able to store more things efficiently on go.

  

Eventhough, there is physical storage for material things but it goes out of topic so as per context we're going to specifically focus on electronic storage which is basically non volatile electronic memory that we use on most electronic devices like PCs, smartphones, music players etc which can store data permanently thought over the years inventors created number of different types of electronic memory but the modern one which we are widely using around the world is electronically erasable read only memory inshort EEPROM that technology at present is integrated mainy on HDDs aka hard disk drives and SSDs aka sold state drives they  both are amazing but difference here is HDDs are less price and store recorded data using platters while SSDs are quite expensive and use flash memory which is way more modern and faster than HDDs so as per requirements use right one.

  

Nowadays, most makers integrating HDDs on electronic devices and a lot of people like and prefer to use them over SSDs because HDDs are less expensive and does job pretty well though in parrallel SSDs are also in wide usage and it also has potential to fully replace HDDs in future but at present considering userbase SSDs are not upto level of HDDs at the end HDD or SDD are available in different sizes and capacities from kbs aka kilobytes to zbs aka zetabytes which when integrated and comes inbuild on electronic devices like PCs or smartphones it is considered as internal storage of device where you can store OS and whatever digital files you want easily thought if you got big internal storage most likely you don't have to worry but if you have small HDD or SSD or you are someone who wanna store files which exceed capacity of internal storage in that case you may have to depend and connect external storages to electronic devices.

  

You may probably already aware of external storages like portable HDDs and SSDs, pendrives, SD cards they can be connected to electronic devices to use as additional storage space when internal one is not enough or for whatever reason you want secondary storage thought you can store almost all digital files on external storage but moving and running certain system files and resources is not possible unless system allows device thought on most PC operating systems by simply enabling superadminstator you can move and run system resources on external storages but when it comes to smartphone operating systems like Android it's bit hard as you have to first unlock bootloader and install rooting softwares like SuperSu or Magisk to get write access to system partition after that only you'll be able to move and run system resources on external storages but thing is all this process voids device warranty.

  

Android is well known popular mobile operating system which is basically free and open source software released by Google that currently has more than 70% worldwide and over the years rapidly gone through many developements to make it modern one suitable and flexible for most users at first in early versions of Android thought not all system resources but if device support SD card we used to get option to move system apps to SD card but for whatever reason Google removed move app to SD card option in the latest versions of Android and introduced format as SD card option that let you use your external SD card as internal storage which is pretty useful for those who have less internal storage and wanna increase it but thing is for a lot of people it's not always possible to use SD card as internal storage right? If possible better try to keep them seperate so that you'll have internal as well as external storage to use effectively.

  

But, the problem here is it's not always possible to store certain system resources on internal storage isn't it? mainly because they occupy so much space for instance when it comes to software applications of Android OS which are known as apps available in format .apk when they get installed on device if .apk size and it's resources are big then they occupy a lot of space on internal storage including that when you keep on using and storing data on app it stores user cache that further decrease space of internal storage which is something a lot of people don't want to happen and wish to store Android apps on secondary storage SD card so that they can have more space on primary internal storage but as said earlier on new Android versions Google removed move app to SD card option so now to move apps to SD card for that we have to use root apps they'll do all process quite efficiently.

  

We have many amazing root apps which have functionality to move apps to sd card but the problem here is many root apps are paid and most of them ask you to make secondary partition or format SD card to move apps which wipe existing user data including that many move apps to sd card apps are limited in features and out of them most are outdated and only available for old Android versions that's because back in early era of Android OS we used to have small storage capacity smartphones so at that time it's important for a lot of people to must have move app to SD card app as without them device is bit difficult to use as there is demand most developers used to keep them up to date but now we are getting big storage capacity smartphones so for most people internal storage is enough to keep almost everything but still there are some people  who want reliable root app to move apps to SD card safely, are you one of them?

  

The reason why some people want to move apps to SD card is mainly because many low and mid end smartphones come with less storage space thought on high end ones we get big storage space but for some users it's not enough at the end  mostly such users want reliable app to move apps to SD card though there are many good root apps on Google Play to do that job but wait don't rush there is one reliable feature rich app named Scene5 which is not available on Google Play but can do alot of system customization on Android including move apps to SD card though it's actually made for Mediatek processor smartphones but it also work on Qualcomm Snapdragon ones with support for latest Android versions but note kindly don't mess with certain things on Scene5 without knowledge as it can either hard or softbrick Android device which is likely fixable but sometimes irreparable, so do you like it? are you still interested? If yes let's explore more.
