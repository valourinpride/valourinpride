There are millions of revolutionary inventions created by people around the world out of them Computer is one first founded by Charles Babbage who build world's first Computer named Difference Engine at first most computers are build up of hardware based mechanical parts but later on when we entered in electricity era people and companies around the world invented electronic products for various purposes in that process we got electronic computers.

  

John Vincent Atanasoff invented world's first electronic computer named ABC aka Atanasoff-Berry computer that can totally replace non-electronic computers after that alot of inventors and companies build and upgraded electronic computers to add more facilities and features by adapting to new technologies accordingly which can do real life tasks electronically.

  

In early year 1950s, General Motors created world's first operating system basically software using number of programming languages for IBM computer to do programmed tasks after that many people and companies build thier own operating systems for computers.

  

However, in beginning computers are very big and expensive thus not everyone can afford them and they're not home friendly as well but later on alot of inventors and companies for personal or commercial reasons reduced the size and price of computers due to them we got home friendly PCs aka personal computers.

  

PCs come with powerful hardware and operating systems where you can install more softwares to do tasks electronically and digitally if programmed correctly but at first most PCs used to run on CLI aka command line interface based operating systems where you have to type and send commands to use it which are very much used by many coders and developers.

  

Even though, comman people can also use CLI operating systems but not easy you have to learn command lines or even programming language itself based on operating system which is why Inventors and companies created GUI aka graphical user interface operating system where you can see things to access them easily using cursor enabled by PC mouse.

  

Fortunately, there are numerous GUI based operating systems invented by developers and companies around the world over the years on PCs especially in 21st century of modern digital era we have advanced GUI based operating systems with integrated CLI where you can install more softwares by using them you can do almost all real life physical tasks digitally.

  

Apple inc. is popular american PC maker founded by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak who from start used closed source GUI based operating system for commercial reasons thus no one can check or use it's  code as it is encrypted that may cause risk to your privacy and security which is why alot of people use open source operating system on PCs to be in safe zone.

  

In open source operating systems code is public where anyone can check and use code even contribute for development to improve or add more features as there is transparency you will get best privacy and security in every corner of usage so due to that majority of developers and companies over the years created alot of open source operating systems for PCs.

  

Thankfully, in year 2000 Apple inc. also released it's own unix like open source operating system named DarwinOS based on code of FreeBSD, NextStep, Mach open source operating systems but later on for whatever reasons after 1 year they again on PC switched to closed source operating system named MacOS.

  

iMac is popular PC series from Apple inc. which gone through rapid developments for more then two decades and uses MacOS for long time that many users like to use but some people especially those who prefer Darwin want MacOS to be open open source operating system on iMac.

  

It is possible that Apple inc. may open source MacOS in future which is right now closed source because of commercial reasons but in case you don't want to use MacOS yet like iMac or you may want to try open source operating system on iMac without loosing feel of MacOS then for you there is RavynOS.

  

RavynOS formerly known as airyxOS is an secure, stable and performance focused FOSS aka free and  open source operating system derivative of FreeBSD with similar user interface of MacOS which you can install on any PC but the main speciality of RavynOS is It has some compatibility with Darwin and x86-64/arm64 with eventually support for arm macOS (Mach-O) libraries thus you can compile a Mac application on ravynOS and run it, isn't cool?

  

In sense, you can't directly Install and run MacOS .dmg softwares or you can say apps on ravynOS because it's based on FreeBSD but it uses many components of Darwin OS which is still in development thus it can compile and run few MacOS and Darwin OS apps on RavynOS.

  

Anyhow, the main purpose of ravynOS is to provide better security and security at that same time set you free from Apple inc. ecosystem and especially as ravynOS is based on FreeBSD it can also run FreeBSD ports and Linux apps that support Waydroid seamlessly, so do you like it? are you interested in RavynOS? If yes let's explore more.

  

Note : ravynOS is still in Alpha developer preview stage which means development is in progress so you may find bugs or limited number of features but eventually ravynOS may fix all issues and release more interesting and exciting features in future, so do you like it? are interested in ravynOS ? If yes let's explore more.
