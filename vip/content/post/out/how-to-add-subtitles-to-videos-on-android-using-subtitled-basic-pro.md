Do you create videos for YouTube or watch movies? if so then probably your videos may be watched by people around the world right? just like you watch videos and movies of other languages isn't? then you must provide your videos in different languages that is super hard right? Instead you may atleast provide Subtitles to videos so that your viewers will understand your videos by enabling regional subtitles.

  

YouTube don't automatically provide subtitles even on some movies that you download from movie sites don't provide subtitles as many creators usually target thier country language audience and don't release subtitles especially for old movies and TV series you won't find subtitles due to that people were unable to understand the content of videos and movies.

  

Fortunately, we are in era of digital technology where we have super and amazing OTT aka over the top streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime etc over there you'll get millons of movies with numerous different language subtitles by default even YouTube creators especially big subscriber base channels are adding hard subtiles on videos to reach people around the globe.

  

But, as we said earlier there are many videos and movies mainly old ones that don't have subtitles so numerous people who know the language of that particular videos or movies that don't have subtitles are voluntarily adding or making subtitles to them if they know the language using text editor or subtitles editor softwares.

  

Yes, you can add or make subtitles to any video or movies using simple text editor available on your file manager but it's very hard as you have do alot of manual work which is why most people especially expert subtitle providers use softwares or articifical intelligence based platforms to automatically make or translate subtitles.

  

We have several popular subtitle editor softwares and online subtitle editor sites available for desktops and smartphones out of them desktops has best subtitle editor softwares while for smartphones we do have subtitle editors but there are very basic and not up to mark of desktops thus I'm not impressed with them.

  

I've been searching for best subtitle editor for smartphones from long time which has features like desktop subtitle editors but I didn't found one unfortunately yet I didn't lost hope and exploring internet for best subtitle editor app once in while and then recently I found one best and super cool subtitle editor named Subtitled.
