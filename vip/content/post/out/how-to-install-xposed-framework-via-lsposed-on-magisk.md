Xposed Framework is the hub of 1000's of best and useful modules, when magisk not come into existence, Xposed Framework is the only choice available for Android users

however most people started switching to magisk a rooting software as they created repository for magisk modules.

  

But, John Wu founder and developer of Magisk discontinued module repository as it's hard to manage with other projects, 

eventhough you can still install modules from storage, anyway there are many people who like Xposed Framework over Magisk repository as you don't have to import modules from storage.

  

Xposed Framework can be installed on Android device through custom recovery like TWRP, however with the help of LSposed module you can install on Magisk and run Xposed Framework including that you can also install and run Riru and Shamiko with different versions of LSPosed.

  

Note : In order to install LSPosed you have to first unlock bootloader and root Android using Magisk which voids warrany, anyway you can use the original version of Magisk from John wu but I suggest using custom magisk created by founder and developer of BiTGApps - @TheHitMan7, on custom magisk you will get MagiskHide which is actually discontinued by John Wu in his releases of Magisk, isn't amazing?
