Ovens, a container to cook and bake food existed from long time but the first official oven recorded in year 1490 in france build using bricks and tiles from then we got to see different types of ovens for home and outdoor purposes, however few decades back ovens are big and very expensive thus not everyone able to use them.

  

The invention of electricity changed the way we live right? as people started using electricity and making electronic products to ease works isn't? over the years from 17 century we got to see millons of electronic products created and developed by people around the world and on June 30, 1893 for the first time William Hardaway issued the first patent for electric oven.

  

Electric ovens released in early 19th century use electricity and they are super big and expensive thus not everyone can afford them but eventually the size and price of electric ovens reduced alot thanks to competition among companies because of them in 20th century we now have small and affordable electric ovens.

  

Right now, there are different types of electric ovens but Microwave ovens are popular these days that heats and cooks food quickly and efficiently by exposing it to electromagnetic radiation in microwave frequency range, In 1947 raytheon build the microwave oven that costs 3.9 lakh INR ,- 5000$, super expensive right?

  

Eventhough, Microwave ovens in early phase are big and expensive yet due to launch of new technologies and never ending competition among companies reduced the size and price of Microwave ovens to such extent that we now can buy electric Microwave ovens under 5000 INR - 50$ in most countries.

  

Electric ovens are pretty common in developed countries like USA and UK as they usually pre-install some type of electric ovens in thier home but in india most people are unaware of electric ovens especially in rural and tribal areas as they got used to traditional food cooking and heating pratices using wood fire or electric and gas stoves etc.

  

However, In india development of electronic industry started in early 1950s and 1960s from then india started importing number of electronic products from foriegn countries and in this process microwave oven entered into india electric market and distributers started selling in shops but only few people used to buy them as they're are expensive and most indian people don't know about electric Microwave ovens even at the time.

  

Fortunately, Economic reforms in 1991  and India's visons towards technology we now have modern and technology era in india with millions of digital platforms so most people now aware and has access to majority of electronic products existed in foriegn countries including Microwave.

  

In 21st century, you can get thousands of microwave oven products list on internet in one search so it is bit hard to choose and buy one especially in india as most people still unaware of how Microwave ovens work? Even in other countries it is  challenging to select best microwave oven due to similar features and competitive pricing on Microwave ovens products.

  

Generally, you may choose Microwave oven products from popular and established electronics manufacturing company like Samsung but if you take more depper look into specifications of other Microwave oven products from new electronic companies then very likely in most cases you will get better features and pricing as they want to grow sells and increase brand reputation and Indentity for example : Amazon Basics.

  

In simple, Amazon is well known popular online shopping site created by Jeff Bezos which used to sell books in early days but eventually started selling all products on it's platform and in 2009 they even started manufacturing several electronic products in name of Amazon Basics.

  

Amazon basic products exclusively only available on Amazon online shopping site and they are pretty good with affordable pricing for all ranges from low to high budgets, and thankfully there is this well priced AmazonBasics Microwave oven which we got our hands on that has nice quality with amazing features.

Foremost, the first primary thing I like about AmazonBasics convection Microwave oven is it has only black colour which is most preffered choice among majority of buyers so you don't have to think much about deciding color of Microwave but it would be better if Amazon launch more colors as there are people who like light colours as well.

  

Usually, Microwave ovens under 10,000 INR - 100$ don't include grill mode but on AmazonBasics Microwave oven you will get grill mode with 65 auto cook menus as an special feature including that which you will get numerous other features that you don't get on other Microwave ovens.

  

AmazonBasics convection Microwave oven has many useful and awesome features like pre-heat function, auto cook menus, child lock, sleek design, timer, LED panel, bake, grill, cook, defrost, 23 litre capacity suitable for 3 to 4 members family, child lock and many more with 1 year warranty on 3 years warranty on Magnetron isn't impressive?  

  

While, you won't get big LED panel, sleek design and grill mode under 10,000 INR - 100$ pricing range so considering this we can conclude AmazonBasics convection Microwave oven is best Microwave oven under 10,000rs - 100$ in india, I'm not sure about other countries.

  

In our usage AmazonBasics Microwave didn't got any issue thus we didn't got any chance to see how Amazon repair it's AmazonBasics products but Amazon is known for top quality customer care and service so you don't have to worry much about it, if you got any problems with AmazonBasics Microwave then simply call Amazon customer care they will guide you.

Atlast, this are just highlighted features of AmazonBasics Microwave there may be many hidden features in-build that provides you external benefits to give the ultimate usage experience, anyway if you want one of the best Microwave under 10,000 INR - 100$ in india then check out AmazonBasics 23L Microwave on go.

  

Overall, AmazonBasics Microwave sleek and modern design with attractive orange shades on handle and buttons that ensures user friendly experience, but in any product there is always space for improvement so let's wait and see will AmazonBasics get any major UI changes in future to make it even more better, as of now AmazonBasics Microwave is cool.

  

Moreover, it is definitely worth to mention AmazonBasics Microwave js one of the very few Microwave ovens that has auto cook menu and grill mode under 10,000 INR - 100$, yes indeed if you're searching for such Microwave then AmazonBasics Microwave has potential to become your new favourite choice.
