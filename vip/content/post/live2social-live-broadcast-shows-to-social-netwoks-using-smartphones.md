Camera is an hardware device that can capture real world objects invented atleast two centuries back at first camera used to capture black and white photographs and then films after long time thanks to many Inventors and companies for personal or commercial reasons they developed color cameras but they all used to capture either photographs or films on negetive reels so you can't see them until they go through labs that's expensive and takes time.

  

Fortunately, Eastman Kodak engineer Steven Sasson in year 1975 build an revolutionary digital camera that uses electricity and software to capture digital photographs and films known as images and videos which are further developed by numerous companies in that process by early 20th century we got modern digital cameras powered by advanced and powerful latest technologies.

  

Digital cameras capture images and videos on in-built hardware storage like hard or static drive disks thus you can see them in real time on an external display or check them on compatible electronic device like computers simple right? which is why almost all photographers and film makers eventually shifted to digital camera leaving negetive reel cameras.

  

Anyhow, Modern camera are equipped with latest digital technologies by using them you not can capture high resolution images but also record videos including that you can live broadcast them to TVs and social networks available on world wide web of internet but studio level DSLR technology camera with tools is costly so not everyone can afford them.

  

Thankfully, In early 20th century we got smartphones an electronic device similar to computer came in replacement to mobile phones at first they used to only available in high price but eventually price reduced to affordable range which are since the entry gradually integrated with cameras then upgraded them to level in both hardware and software wise due to that they are now capable to multi-live stream images and videos to television and social media networks efficiently.

  

Now, smartphones are widely used by alot of people which has alot of live stream digital softwares known as apps developed over the years competing with computer by using them you can easily live broadcast images and videos to television and social media networks anywhere and anytime comfortably.

  

But, majority of live broadcast apps available on smartphones lacks certain options and features which is why you can't live stream images and videos on television and social media networks etc to the level of studio but developers are constantly working on to bring all studio level tools on mobile as right now we have capable modern smartphones.

  

There are many live stream softwares on smartphones which are directly available in social media networks itself but we have only limited number of multi stream softwares in that only few have studio level live broadcast tools but most of them are costly so if you want to live broadcast for free then they may won't work for you.

  

Recently, we found one of the best live broadcast app named Live2.Social integrated with studio level tools developed for creators to share content that can multi Iive stream images and videos to television and popular social media networks like Facebook, LinkedIn, 

YouTube and Twitch seamlessly.
