2007 is the year when Apple inc. well known and popular american PC maker released world's first revolutionary multi-touch display technology electronic smartphone named iPhone which is Integrated with GUI aka graphical user interface software that you can simply access and use with finger tips unlike PC where in order to use any GUI software you have to use cursor mouse that you have to point at required locations then click right or left buttons of mouse to do anything.

  

In sense, on smartphones we simply tap on it's multi-touch screen to access and use any GUI based softwares which is quite convenient and comfortable though modern electronic PCs that people around the world widely use now does have multi touch screen display technology but thing is they are big and not handheld devices due to that it's bit hard and difficult to use them on move which is why most people to do any tasks use smartphones.

  

Smartphones are handheld electronic devices with up to 7 inch size which is basically evolution of PDAs - personal digital assistants came to totally replace keypad mobile phones that can do almost all tasks of PCs though in the beginnings almost all smartphones are not powerful and advanced enough to compete with the PCs but thanks to many companies who over the years done number of upgrades on smartphones due to that they become modern and got ability to do almost all real life tasks electronically and digitally.

  

Nowadays, majority of people using smartphones over PCs as they are Integrated with powerful and advanced hardware and software to use various different technologies on the go but thing is in order to do anything on smartphone you have to tap on screen manually which is though common and same on the PCs there are certain percentage of people who want to auto tap basically click to automate tasks on smartphones so that they can auto repeat same actions on software to complete tasks easily.

  

Even though, almost all smartphones makers don't directly provide auto click and automate tasks options or features due to various reasons mainly because most people don't demand and require them but if you need them then for you many third party developers over the years created numerous auto click apps so that by using them you'll be able to automate various different tasks on smartphones conveniently and comfortably on the go.

  

There are many amazing GUI softwares known as operating systems available for smartphones out of them Android by search engine giant Google is well known and popular one which has more then 70% worldwide market share though it doesn't have inbuild auto click functionality but has number of third party apps which don't even require device root access by using them you can auto click all the softwares available on Android extensively.

  

  

But, if you have root access on your smartphone then you'll get more more options and features than no root auto click software available for Android devices but thing is in order to root latest modern Android smartphones you need to first unlock bootloader and flash custom recovery like TWRP after that install root softwares like SuperSu or Magisk which unlock system level access that is risky and voids device warranty so if you are newbie it's better to stay away for them and right on use no root auto click apps.
