Once in while, nowadays most people want to capture images and videos using digital cameras available mainly on DSLRs and smartphones or any other electronic devices like PCs and surveillance cameras etc for various purposes isn't it? In order to capture themselves or something else and then view them using numerous softwares but the drawback with most digital camera softwares on DSLR or smartphone is they thought can capture high quality images and videos in numerous digital formats but mostly big size so to save them you need huge hardware storage capacity.

  

The size of images and videos captured by digital cameras depend on several factors like number of megapixels and the quality of them digitally including that it also based on encoding digital format for instance images in PNG format are big size then JPG as PNG store more quality which is used for logos and then when it comes to videos .mkv format videos are much bigger then .MP4 which is why it's important to select right image and video encoding format on your digital camera software before capturing them according to requirements and storage capacity else you may have to use certain softwares to reduce size of them for sure.

  

Majority of people around the world since long time using numerous video editing and media encoder softwares which are developed using programming languages like C, Python etc available on electronic devices like PCs aka personal computers and smartphones where you can change image or video bitrate and quality basically resolution including that you can change its width and height and encoding digital format of them to reduce size accordingly but the thing here is this process decrease quality of them that not everyone like to do as in most cases it's important to have the orginal quality of them, isn't that right?

  

Even though, there are certain encoding  formats available for both images and videos on media encoding softwares which though convert them into their format but won't change or effect overall quality of them yet reduces their size immensely but this process that you can designate will only be applied when you already have huge size images or videos on hardware storage like HDDs and SDDs aka harddrive and static drive disks which can be dissapointing as most people want to live capture images and videos in small sizes without losing overall quality using digital cameras not the afermath media editors or encoder softwares etc.

  

Fortunately, we do have some digital cameras mainly DSLRs aka Digital Single-Lens Reflex that are specifically designed and developed to capture professional images and videos which usually provide certain digital encoding formats to capture images and videos in small sizes but right now majority of people from last decade since the entry of smartphones using their digital cameras to capture high quality images and videos extensively which for whatever reasons usually don't provide small size capture encoding softwares instead by default they stick with big size ones due to that smartphone users they either need big hardware storage or use media editors or encoders that in some scenarios not possible isn't it?

  

Thankfully, some small size video encoding digital formats are supported on smartphones, but before we going to know about them, do you know what exactly are cameras if you're not aware of them then for you in simple as possible, camera era started in early 18th century back then they are mechanical and used to capture real world in black and white on color paper known as photographs after that it gone through many advancements by inventors around the world due to that we eventually got electronic cameras with ability to capture color photographs and moving pictures known as films mostly on negetive reels then after long time in year 1970s we got to see digital cameras which capture photographs and films in digital formats known as images and videos that are now widely used by people worldwide.

  

Anyhow, now let's get back to point as said earlier small size video encoding digital formats are available on smartphones for Instance HEVC/H.265 and AVC/H.264 digital encoding format created by Canon  can capture videos at quite less size without losing resolution quality at first it is only available on DSLRs but on Android powered smartphones from 7.0 nougut version it got support for them so you are able to capture them on the go but at present most stock Android camera apps capture videos in .MP4 or .mkv so if you want to record HEVC videos then you may have to rely on third party camera apps.

  

Recently, we found an camera app named Ultracorder with full camera resolution that supports HEVC/H.265 a new digital encoding format that can capture videos at half the size of AVC/H.264 and both are supported but kindly do remmember HEVC depends of hardware encoding of device including that if your device can't play HEVC videos then you may have to use compatible MX Player or VLC Player apps, so do you still like it? are you interested? If yes then let's explore more.
