There are two types of camera, pinhole ones used to capture real life objects in black and white or color photographs and moving pictures known as films on paper or negative reels and then comes digital camera that uses hardware and software to do same job of pinhole camera but the digital ones are much better as it capture photographs and films in digital formats 

known as images and videos with audios at big size and high resolution and quality capable of storing huge size digital files based on hardware storage capacity of hardware and static drives, isn't cool?

  

Now, we have modern computers and smartphones mainly big size home TVs and projectors to view pin hole or digital camera photographs and films but few decades back there are not many options except DVD players and theatres which are well used by people even now alot of them due to various reasons prefer them over modern computers and smartphones.

  

However, DVD player require CD-R discs and should to be connected with TV aka television to play images or videos of any type either it's regular or cinematic ones but TVs are usually home compatible and big size ones are expensive so people who want to watch movies at big screen like to go regular or imax theatres as over there now they'll get 70 to 100mm screen with dolby audios and 3D view support etc.

  

Even though, it is possible to setup theatre level facilities and functionalities in home or any other space for best comfort and convenience but it's quite expensive which is why most people who can't afford them spend little money to buy tickets and go to desired type and area theatre to see and enjoy movies according to availability.

  

But, majority of people can't always go outside to reach theatres including that theatres only play new movies that to in limited areas, countries and theatres for few days or months according to demand to make business due to that people who want to watch old or new movies have no choice other then to view them on modern TVs, computers and smartphones which don't provide theater level experience.

  

Fortunately, In this modern digital world there are many revolutionary technologies out of them virtual reality is one that was coined and development begin in mid 19th century but only from past few years got upgrades and prominence thanks to alot of companies who expanding the potential and capabilities of virtual reality through VR headsets using different technologies mainly in Integration of extended reality.

  

VR aka Virtual reality handsets at first used concave lens then later on fresnel lens and now xtal lens etc which provide a space to fit smartphone where you have to play virtual reality supported image, video, games etc then it just not show them in big screen but also dive into virtual reality or environment that will feel like real with 

3D and spatial audio surround sound and sensation technologies and many more.

  

If you don't have virtual reality images and videos then you have to make regular ones compatible using virtual reality video players availabile for computers and smartphones with different features and options but most of them don't focus much on providing theatre environment to users on the go, isn't disappointing?

  

Recently, we found an virtual reality video player developed especially for cinemas and movies named Irusu Cinema VR player that has many features and options to name few immersive Imax and big cinema theater screen sizes with seat selection to view the movie from different angles that may definitely amazed you.

  

Irusu cinema VR player also has 3D Dolby-like dual surround sound system, 2K and 4K video resolution support, automatic aspect ratio adjustment, video seek bar with advanced video rendering algorithms, smooth controls, and easy refresh media thus you were able to play virtual reality content easily without any hassles.

  

Currently, most of the video players that we get on app market places are virtual reality ones which are usually don't have support for augmented reality as well as mixed and extended reality likewise Irusu is one of them but it may add support for those technologies in future.

  

Note : it supports all types of Google Cardboard, Irusu VR headsets, VR box, Shinecon VR, and other mobile-based virtual reality headsets with any lens but latest ones have better quality so do you like it? are you interested in Irusu Cinema VR player? If yes let's explore more.
