We\\"re in era of Millennials and Gen-Z where people not spending enough time to play outdoor games due to rapid progress of technology we can do almost anything from home itself like sending messages,  meeting people and shopping using virtual reality, do payments etc thus people using desktops, smartphones, and gaming consoles to digitally play outdoor games from indoor spaces, progressive right?

  

Do you like home video games? and are you from 1980\\"s if yes then you may probably used or atleast once heard of home video game consoles like Nintendo and Atari right? which are still in market but alot of home video game consoles discontinued for instance ColecoVision.

  

ColecoVision is well known home video game console developed by Coleco in 1982 but as Coleco withdrawn from market they discontinued home video game consoles in 1985, anyhow when  Coleco nearly went bankrupt electronic products like ColecoVision home video game consoles not just saved them but also turned company into making profits.

  

Eventhough, ColecoVision come with own  games but the contract with Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi to license and include Donkey Kong on ColecoVision home video game consoles played major role in success of ColecoVision due to that Coleco sold 500,000 units and surpassed 1 million units by 1983.

  

However, as said earlier Coleco discontinued ColecoVision home video game consoles in 1985 so right now in order to play Coleco games you have to either buy old ColecoVision home video game console or use unofficial emulators to play ColecoVision games on smartphones or PC.

  

In 2007, Apple launched Iphone from then market for advanced smartphones was started that dropped sales of home video game consoles at big percentage as people started shifting to smartphones from home video game consoles to play all types of games.

  

Most home video game console manufacturing companies know that smartphones has potential to support video games but still they won\\"t develop video games for smartphones as it will further drop sells of home video game consoles, but thankfully many developers managed to build unofficial emulators to play almost all home video games on smartphones like PPSSPP, Citra 3DS, Skyline Emulator, AetherSX2 etc.

The development of unofficial emulator for smartphones is difficult as developers are not associated with home video game console makers so they won\\"t get any type of support thus developers have to make alot of things themselves and face many struggles to build software and hardware compatible emulator for smartphones that takes time that\\"s why developers make thier project open source on GitHub to fastrack unofficial emulators.

  

Anyhow, actually people extract video game software known as roms from real video gaming consoles to upload on internet without permission from video game console companies thus it\\"s illegal but still people like to download and play video games using un-official emulators over home video game consoles.

  

Recently, we found an amazing emulator named ColEm by using that you can play discontinued home video game console ColecoVision games on smartphones, so do you like it? are you interested in ColEm? If yes let\\"s know little more info before we explore more.
