\- Go to [medium.com](http://medium.com) and sign with you google gmail I'd! 

  

\- Once it's verified, you have two options either you can access desktop mode or install mobile client. 

  

 We suggest you to use desktop version as medium app client is not yet ready to give all features there are some drawbacks you have on mobile app like you don't have op- tion to add search description. 

  

So, its better to use desktop version in your mobile browser or desktop mode in your laptop or PC where you have all the features needed for write articles with all the required features. 

  

But, incase you want to use mobile app of medium which is well optimized to work on all devices but with less features then you can try mobile app.

**Overall**, you have two modes in medium app while the original mode is normal but we personally like beta mode of medium as it will gives option to write article from home screen itself. 

  

**Moreover**, medium is an amazing platform to rank your articles on google search but you you can only post 3 articles daily so post articles or content that you think are important with high quality! 

  

**Finally**, Medium is another success project of Evan Williams after blogger, do you use medium if yes have you got success with medium and do your articles ranked on first page of google results, do mention in our comment section below, see ya :)
