Day after day usage of smartphones increasing rapidly which are basically electronic devices equipped and capable of storing and running modern digital technologies through apps, websites, digital files like images, videos, audios, documents etc available in different flexible digital advanced formats by using them people are not only able to simplify many hard tasks but also do them quite efficiently, isn't that cool and useful?

  

In 21st century large percentage of people everyday using and relying on digital technologies available and accessible on smartphones to do various different personal or work and business related important things which are private and usually people don't want anyone to secretly snoop or spy on them so to secure them almost all makers of smartphones since long time providing powerful and advanced security systems with screen locks and fingerprint scanner for additional security on the go.

  

Eventhough, at present almost all smartphones provide screen locks with fingerprint scanner for whole device as well as for apps and files but some old and stock Android softwares don't provide any default options and features to lock files and apps due to that some people find and use third party apps to lock or hide apps and files which are fine but most of them are not upto mark and don't use sophisticated encryptors to do this job which is kinda problematic for sure.

  

If you have important files then it's always better to lock or hide important files and apps to protect them and be in safe zone but thing is not everyone have default system feature to do this which is why some people encrypt files and device using certain softwares available for PCs and smartphones which is way better and secure method than locking of hiding files and apps using unreliable apps though encryption technology is very suitable it takes some time to process based on data size and device specifications etc.

  

In sense, digital file encryption technology is not for everyone some people basically want to hide or lock files and apps so that they can access them easily if you're one of them then you probably already tried number of default system or third party apps to lock apps and files isn't it? like in our case most of them didn't impress you and you may very likely looking out for a better alternative to them right? In such scenario you're now at right place.

  

The main problem with most file or app hide and lock apps is they are closed source due to that if their developers add any suspicious code in software code you won't easily know unless you're developer with skills to decrypt and check else any malicious code in those apps can access your private data in apps or files and send them to untrusty sources that can cause  personal and financial losses which is why to not let that happen it's always better to use open source apps to this job.

  

Most developers release code of open source apps in public domain in Internet through public repositories on contributive development platforms like GitHub and GitLab etc where anyone through web can check and validate code of their interested software projects as there is transparency you will get security including that anyone can use their code to make custom clients of open source apps which not only speed up but also improve development of open source apps effectively and extensively.

  

Recently, we got to know about an lightweight free and open source app material3 user interface app named Amarok that uses sophisticated encryptors to hide large files and apps in one click instantly which basically obfuscate file names and file signatures to make files and apps unreadable at present Amarok supports root, shizuku, DSM modes, so do you like it? are you interested in Amarok If yes then let's explore more.
