The day digital cameras entered in market they are quite revolutionary and changed various aspects of world as you may know once upon a time there used to be pinhole and negetive reel cameras which used to capture real world objects on color papers and reels in black and white or color mode known as photographs inshort photos and films which are physical materials due to that makers won't be able to do much on them but things were different with digital cameras as they capture photographs and images in digital format known as images and videos due to that makers are able to do alot of things with them extensively.

  

Digital cameras are electronic devices integrated with hardware and software which work together to capture real world objects in the beggining digital cameras used to be basic with low resolution lens and rely on old technologies due to that they used to capture low quality images and videos but later on companies around the world begin upgrading digital cameras by adapting to latest technologies due to that we got powerful and advanced digital cameras which can capture images and videos in HD aka high definition quality thanks to that people in large numbers eventually to shifted to digital cameras.

  

In 21st century many companies for personal and commercial reasons integrated digital cameras on number of electronic devices mainly on smartphones and PCs which already have number of inbuild modern technologies due to that capabilities of digital cameras increased further and got ability to capture images and videos in various different qualities and formats efficiently thanks to such flexibility of digital cameras most people who want to capture images and videos easily shifted to digital cameras available on PCs and mainly on smartphones.

  

In sense, PCs and smartphones can do a of things with images and videos as they are digital formats basically softwares like to name few changing the file name or converting them to different formats even compress the file size by reducing quality including that the main advantage is when images and videos captured using camera software available on PCs or smartphones those images and videos store almost all required details in metadata like software settings even include location if you allow it using GPS due to that you or anyone can check and keep track of them effectively.

  

It is important to know metadata of images and videos so that people based on their requirements can use them accordingly like for Instance when someone capture image or video including location in metadata then it helps people in numerous ways mainly travellers and photo or videographers who based on location available can go to that place to see or capture the same place in different angles mainly companies could check the place to start something productive over there which is why many people like to include location details in metadata of images and video, isn't that cool?

  

Especially, in order to remmember certain places it's always better to add location data in metadata of images and videos though now a days thanks to softwares large percentage of people adding exact location details on images and videos automatically but thing is not everyone want to add location of certain places on images and videos for various different reasons mainly to protect privacy which is why certain percentage of people when capturing images and videos turn off the location access to their device and camera software as well, are you one of them?

  

Usually, most people who want privacy and anonymity don't add location or any other details in metadata of images and videos but sometimes mistakes can happen isn't it? If you for whatever reason don't want images and videos to reveal location of places or any other details to anyone then you probably have to remove metadata of them before sharing to fellow people and companies which is possible but thing is by default camera softwares of PCs and smartphones don't provide this facility so you usually have to rely on third party softwares to get this job done.

  

Recently, we got to know about an simple and assuring app named Scrambled Exif for smartphones which can delete all metadata of images before sharing instantly and there's another powerful and advanced app named Exif Pro which not just remove metadata but also add fake ones to images, videos and audios so that you can protect your work and privacy of digital files on the go, so do you like it? are you interested in Scrambled Exif and Exif Pro? if yes then let's explore more.
