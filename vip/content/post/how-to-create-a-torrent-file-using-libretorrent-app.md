Torrent files are not traceable as there is no single IP used to transmit files, torrent files use seeding and trackers to transfer files to numerous users, this is why most piracy websites use torrent files to send latest movies so that no one can detect and catch person behind the copyright infringements.

  

If you care about privacy and security then you can create torrent files to share files anonymously as the torrent files you create will be on your PC or smartphone, but when you upload copyrighted files on cloud servers which has policies that will comply with law enforcements, then they will check user logs like account details and IP details to trace your IP and catch you with warrant to present in court and then judges will punish you if they found you guilty with proper proofs.

  

This is why, to escape from law enforcements pirates create torrent files, even if pirates use cloud servers to share copyrighted materials on Internet they will use fake details then hide thier original IP using proxies, socks, TOR etc even some pirates use dark web and telegram etc, that's why law enforcements were unable to catch pirates, so eventually they end up 

sending complaints to DMCA and they will block and close website domains on basis of copyright infringements.

  

This is what happening from last decade, however most people don't know how to create Torrent files, by creating torrent files you will get numerous benefits like anonymity and you can create torrent files of small and big files with no size limit and download speed of torrent file is based on seeders, while most file hosting platforms limit cloud storage and download speed which is unsatisfactory.

  

So, incase if you're facing troubles and issues with file hosting platform and cloud servers and want a alternative platform to share files on Internet anonymously then you can create torrent files, now we are going to show you how to easily create torrent files using LibreTorrent app.
