Browser, the one that you're using now is basically digital software created using number of programming languages like C, Java etc which is specifically designed and developed to crawl Internet right? the world's first browser named world wide web was created and released by inventor Tim Berners Lee back in year 1991 which access public contents hosted on internet using URL aka uniform resource locator also known as links simply on the go.

  

Internet is created by ARPANET back in year 1969 which is basically network of computers a standard protocol that assigns unique identification address known as IP aka Internet protocol to each and every computer then move digital data on network between computers at first it is private and was primarily used to send digital messages between computers then after that for long time Internet was used for same purpose extensively.

  

Fortunately, many inventors upgraded internet due to that it became powerful and advanced enough for communication around the world effectively but back then internet used to be private but eventually as said earlier when WWW came up it allowed to access public contents of internet that are basically online digital softwares that requires internet to work known as websites and blogs etc.

  

Thankfully, WWW is revolutionary software created for PCs aka personal computers and other electronic devices that amazed large percentage of people worldwide so in order to access their softwares on web many people with their PCs developed websites and blogs then they by using PC storage and memory to created server that work as virtual bridge to host and access on internet, isn't that quite amazing?

  

But, In beginnings digital softwares like websites and blogs used to be basic as back then they are mostly developed using only .html aka hypertext programming language but eventually mainly since 20th century in Web 2.0 people started using numerous programming languages like CSS, PHP, JavaScript etc in that process we got modern websites and blogs which look and feel super cool and awesome.

  

Even though, web 2.0 era websites and blogs are better then web 1.0 era as they're well designed and organized with modern graphics which are now a days widely used by large percentage of people around the world but there are some people even now for nostalgia reasons or for simplicity like and prefer to use web 1.0 era websites which usually don't come with modern graphics and most people stopped using them in web 1.0 era itself.

  

The modern browsers like Chrome and Mozilla Firefox available for personal computers and smartphones open websites and blogs as it is with all the graphics existed which don't give the feel of web1.0 era as in that only text is visible and highlighted with no graphics so there are certain percentage of people who want such browsers that can open only text of modern websites and blogs to get look and feel of web1.0 era and simplicity.

  

Recently, we got to know about a simple yet modern text based browser named Violencello with numerous options and features which removes all websites and blog graphics including annoyances like ads and videos and thus you can in simple read text heavy webpages like big articles or online e-books etc without distractions isn't that fabulous and useful? so do you like it? are you interested in Violencello?
