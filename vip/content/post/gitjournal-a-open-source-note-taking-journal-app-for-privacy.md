Note basically means writing down information about something on any material thus you don't usually have to memorize particular information instead you just check noted information and then based on that proceed further, back then like few decades even at present majority of people to note information widely use paper that is made out of tree wood pulp, but there are many better alternatives to  write notes like with electronic devices.

Most people around the world write notes using pencils or ink pens on paper as it's thin sheet available in all colors mainly white and super light weight as well due to that it's not just easy to use but also you can simply carry it around conveniently and comfortably but there are numerous drawbacks with regular papers as they're delicate physical product it can be teared or damaged when certain force applied by you or anyone else, isn't that useful? 

Even though, the destructible nature and quality of paper is definitely good for sure as if you want to disappear your certain paper notes then you can destroy them completely using numerous ways like tearing into short pieces or firing and watering it etc but in some scenarios the same can happen accidentally even the nature itself can do it unintentionally for instance dust or rain water and sun heat etc can damage paper totally which can cause personal or financial losses.

Especially, paper is though foldable material that fits in small space and if protected can last forever but it's hard to do it and if you're someone who like trees and don't want to use it's byproducts like paper in order to protect nature then you  may probably don't want to use paper isn't it? incase if you like to use papers then when you want to note down a lot of information you need numerous papers which are not just expensive but also can be bit difficult to maintain them, don't you think?

Now a days, large percentage of people.  in almost all sectors and fields worldwide who don't prefer papers using softwares available on electronic devices like PCs and smartphones as they are cheaper and has capability to store giga and terra byte of data notes in hardware storage digitally and efficiently which are from past several decades mainly since year 1980s working as best replacement to papers worldwide.

The another reason why a lot of people choosing note softwares is because they are quite simple and easy to use where you can write, edit and share notes in different languages and formats based on your requirements accordingly anywhere and anytime and almost all institutions requiring digital notes over paper which is one of the main reasons why many people either for private or public purposes highly using note software on the go.

Meanwhile, note softwares are also used to write personal diary to note down daily life real life events or mental thoughts etc and journals to note down bigger picture details of anything by certain percentage of people based on thier interest or hobby and job work purposes etc which is why since long time numerous developers and companies developing and designing note softwares for diaries and journals etc as well to not just reach more audience but also it's useful and spike up productivity.

There are numerous amazing note softwares with many options and features developed using numerous programming languages for different operating systems like Windows and Linux etc available on PCs and smartphones which are flexible and can save all your notes efficiently but most of them are closed source and ask you to make account to use services that can cause risk to your privacy.

When you make an account on Note softwares either closed or open source ones as right now we are in web 2.0 they mostly host data on centralized servers which are located in one country and they are managed by single or more companies who can access your data without getting your permission and then may sell to third parties illegally that will be troublesome to your privacy and security as they can use your data for advertising or promotional even misuse it, unacceptable right?

Usually, most big companies who make note softwares cleary provide terms of service and policies where they specify how they gonna use your note data based on that you can decide either to use it or not but a lot of new small developers and companies don't even specify details on how they will handle and protect your note data on cloud servers which will eventually can be problematic, isn't disappointing?

Thankfully, In 21st century notes of users stored on softwares thought hosted on top notch secured centralized cloud servers thanks to Inventors who over the years created and adapted to latest required technologies yet still at the end they are centralized due to that they are primarily target and exploited by hackers to extract private notes data and then sell or publish online on internet or darkweb is dangerous that's why it's better to use save notes on web3 softwares to be in safe zone.

Web3 is future upgrade of internet where data will be divided into small parts and encrypted then stored in decentralized cloud servers provided by companies or individuals like you around the world due to that notes that you store on Web cloud decentralized servers are super secure and can't be hacked by anyone remotely but right now Web3 is not full scale and if you for anyone doubt Web3 and want way more control and security then it's better to with note softwares that work offline.

Anyhow, The problem with most closed source note or any other softwares is it's code is encrypted so if developer of them hide any virus or data trackers in it you can't see them due to that your valuable notes can be stolen easily and you won't even known that until you decrypt code which requires developers skills that's why from past years many people who got to know about risks with the closed source software shifting to foss softwares.

On foss - free and open source softwares developers publish all thier code as public repositores on contributive development platforms like GitHub or GitHub etc which provides transparency thus you can simply check it's code to verify it's authenticity if found any suspicious code you can report and stop using it due to that you'll get full  privacy and security, amazing right?

Anyway, If you use any well known popular closed or open source note software from companies then you probably may already seen such note software that let you host your notes on third party cloud servers like Google Drive, OneDrive, Mega etc which is super useful for common people but those cloud servers are not for developers due to that if you want to note something related to coding then it's always better to choose such note software which will let you store notes on git repositories, isn't that right?

Recently, we got to know about offline first ad free no account required open source flutter based privacy and data portability focused note taking and journal app named GitJournal for smartphones that stores all your notes in a standardized Markdown + YAML header format or plaintext format in a hosted Git repository like GitHub, GitLab, Gitea Gogs, or custom-provider etc so do you like it? are you interested in if yes let's explore more.
