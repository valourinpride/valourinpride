Cinema also known as movie which is basically motion pictures of real world objects known as film captured using camera to present a story as per vision of creators at first in beggining era camera used to capture pictures aka photographs in black and white mode but later on many inventors around the world done various different upgrades to camera by adapting to latest technologies in that process we eventually got such cameras which are not only capable of capturing photographs but also films with sound in black and white and color mode, isn't that amazing?

  

Camera in begginings used to capture photographs and films on color paper which are known as pinhole cameras then later on after number of decades we got to see negative reels camera which are way better then pinhole cameras due to that most people around the world eventually shifted and widely started using negetive cameras to capture photographs and films but thing is there are few drawbacks with pinhole and negative reel cameras like to name few they produce photographs and films on physical materials which are not flexible and damageable as well because of that making a full length cinema with them is bit hard and difficult for sure.

  

Eventhough, pinhole and negative reel cameras are not easy to handle and many directors and cinematographers used to don't like them yet still as there is no option they are used for numerous decades to make cinemas around the world but thing is majority of people wanted way better alternative to pinhole and negetive camera as there is huge demand to supply that inventors and companies for personal or commercial reasons continously worked on to create such camera that's better then existing ones by adapting to latest technologies in that process we got digital cameras.

  

Digital camera is revolutionary electronic device evolution of pinhole and negative camera first created by kodak engineer Steve Sasson at first it's basic but over the years it gone through many updates and upgrades due to that now we have quite powerful and advanced modern digital cameras which capture photographs and videos in digital formats known as images and videos basically software developed using numerous programming languages like C, C++ etc as images and videos are digital they are pretty flexible which you can simply capture and instantly view on display screen of electronic devices then  edit them using softwares easily due to that since long time creators using digital cameras to make cinemas on the go.

  

Pinhole or negative reel cameras when you want to make cinema with them in that process you may get point where you have to edit certain photographs and films to get desired result but thing is as said earlier pinhole and negative reel cameras capture photographs and films on physical materials so editing them is not only time taking but also hard task even for a expert yet still as there is no better choice most people used them extensively until digital cameras entered in market which as said earlier capture photographs and films in digital format files known as images and videos as they are digital you can simply store on hard or standard disks drives then edit using many softwares efficiently.

  

There are many things creators edit on photographs and films like removing or adding things additionally on existing ones to make and present visually appealing cinema to audience back in time pinhole and negative reel camera used to capture on physical materials and there are quite limited technologies to edit photographs and films including that in order to edit photographs and films for production of cinema it's important to have studio which is expensive so not everyone could afford and build it except some companies like universal studios and paramount pictures etc but now we are in modern era of digital technologies with modern digital cameras which are Integrated on many electronic devices mainly on handheld smartphones which have many proffesional video editor softwares by using them with right skills anyone can make cinematic images and videos conveniently and comfortably.

  

Color grading is one of the most important thing to make cinema in which creators add various different color filters on photographs and films accordingly based on existing structure to improve and present way better more visually appealing cinema to audience back then in early era of negative camera though color grading thing existed at that time it's bit hard to apply due to physical material based photographs and films with limited color grading technologies but now they are available in digital format as images and videos to edit them there are number of powerful and advanced softwares with latest tools packed with color grading technologies by using them you can make pretty amazing cinemas effectively.
