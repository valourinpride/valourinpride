It is known fact music listening is part of life everyday most people listen music to enjoy or relax as in olden days peope used to listen music by attending concerts later we got TV's & radio after that we got ipods and walkmans to listen music and now we are in the era of smartphones and you just need that to listen unlimited music easily by simply installing a music player app.

  

We have two types of music player apps like offline and online while online music player is right now the most popular and preffered choice among people from past few years due to it's latest technology as people don't need to download any music on thier device & most online music player apps allow users to listen to music online without downloading & mainly most online music players that we have on play store have millions of songs collections from around the world provided absolutely for free to the user without charges.

  

But, the problem is some people don't like to use online music players due to lack of internet connection or because online music players only works when you have good speed internet connection and eventhough online music players allow users to download songs they won't let you transfer them to other devices.

  

So, due to certain restrictions in online music player apps, some people prefer and choose offline music players apps because in offline music apps you don't need internet connection and the music files will be stored locally on your device which you can transfer easily to any other device whenever you want and yeah both offline and online music player apps have thier own prospects and cons so it is upto individual personal choice & interest.

  

However, Music player app either it's offline or online, the basic principle was the better music player app you'll get on smartphone powered by Android or iOS the more amazing music experience you will feel so it is important to have good music player app that you like on your smartphone based on your selection it will provide best music list exploring and listening experience anywhere on the go.

  

In this scenario, we have a workaround we found a offline music player app which is light weight and minimal especially made for music aesthetics for Android by Faisal Arshed named SoundSpice which is not available on playstore but SoundSpice can provide best experience to it's users with it's features, do we got your attention? Are you interested on SoundSpice? If yes let's know little more info before we start exploring SoundSpice.
