Videos are basically films but as they are captured using electronic digital cameras in connection with software they're known as videos and yeah at the end videos and films are same visibly but difference is in back end technology for Instance videos are formed up of digital images and when it comes to films they are formed up with photos, isn't that cool and fascinating?

  

Since, the era of digital cameras started in mid 1970s majority of people around the world eventually shifted to digital cameras from pinhole cameras to capture real life physical objects digitally in many various different software formats like .mp4, .mkv, 3gp, .flv, .mpd etc which all are classified as videos and they're way better than films thanks to modern digital technologies.

  

The main reason why videos are better than films is because films are physical products mostly available in form of paper or negative feels so if they not maintained well then they very likely get damaged over time which is different in case of videos as they are digital softwares developed using number of programming languages so you can only access them through compatible

electronic devices and digital softwares.

  

In sense, videos are digital not physical materials so usually videos are way more flexible then films and very likely videos won't be damaged overtime unless you delete or corrupt it or it happened due to any technical issues in hardware storage or system etc which is why videos are not just widely created but also used by most people for various purposes globally.

  

Nowadays, majority of people using revolutionary electronic devices like DSLR camera and mainly smartphone digital cameras to capture videos at quite high resolution and quality but the thing is when you capture a video you may want to to edit it to remove certain parts or even add any external stuff isn't? to improve or decrease video appearance or quality etc.

  

Generally, most people like to edit their films or videos for various purposes when it comes to films back then people used to take long time to edit them as they have to cut negetive reels to remove any frame or parts of films which is hard and take long time but now we have videos as they're in 

digital format files you can edit them using digital video editor softwares available on PCs or PDAs and smartphones etc.  

  

In 21st century, we have modern video editors which work best on powerful and advanced hardware and software devices by using them you can edit videos the way you want by utilising available tools like you can not just remove or add certain video frames or parts of video but a lot more to name few additional stuff like applying text, mixing audio, backgrounds, graphics, effects, adjust aspect ratio etc.

  

Eventhough, most video editors comes with numerous amazing options and features which are enough to large percentage of people mainly to newbies who do just basic edits to video but there are some people who want to edit videos extensively for such purposes number of companies already created numerous proffesional video editor softwares.

  

Usually, modern PCs used to be more compatible with proffesional video editor softwares but from past one decade mobile companies continously updating and upgrading handheld smartphones due to that they're now powerful and advanced enough to compete with PCs including that smartphones are used by people more then PCs which is why companies developing proffesional video editor softwares for smartphones as well.

  

KineMaster is well known and popular video editor software for smartphones which has many amazing options and features to edit videos but still it lacks a lot of things which are quite required by proffesionals to edit videos extensively that's why most of them like and prefer PCs which have many professional video editor software to edit any format videos conveniently and comfortably on the go.

  

Especially, In order to do VFX aka visual effects editing on videos most people mainly film makers to apply on movies right on choose PCs VFX video editor softwares as they are powerful and advanced enough to handle them and  smartphones used to don't have PC level professional VFX video editor softwares but from past few years we got see some quite useful professional VFX video editor softwares on smartphones as well.

  

Visual effects inshort VFX are basically certain Imaginery graphic visuals of real or fantasy objects which can be created and added on captured video using VFX video editing softwares but thing is doing all this require VFX making skills including that as VFX are graphics in order to process them you need powerful hardware and advanced software on PCs or smartphones else it will take long time to get final results.

  

Usually, film companies use VFX video editor softwares for movies but at present digital cameras are available to everyone which can record videos at high resolution and quality so anyone can make films but the thing is a lot of people don't like and prefer to use PC to do vfx editing on video as PC is not handheld device it's hard to  use on move that's why large percentage of people instead using smartphones.

  

Recently, we got to know about an powerful and advanced modern VFX video editor app for smartphones named Node that has many cool and useful options and features out of them some are powered by AI aka artificial intelligence by using them you can simply do VFX editing of videos quite efficiently and effectively, so do you like it? are you interested in Node video editor?
