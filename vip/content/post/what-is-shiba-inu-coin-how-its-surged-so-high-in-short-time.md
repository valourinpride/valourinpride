Just like bitcoin the founder of Shibu Inu coin is not known except the name ryoshi, he liked to remain anonymous like Satoshi nakamoto which is the top reason behind the success of Shiba Inu even though the Shiba inu is a meme coin got inspired by Dogecoin which has no value at the start of launch in August 2020 but eventually Shiba Inu got amazing super growth when Elon Musk tweet about it.

Elon Musk is a entrepreneur who founded SpaceX, Tesla and many more successful companies which made him once richest man in the world, Elon Musk like futuristic technologies like crypto currency so on his twitter handle he frequently tweets about his favourite decentralised crypto coins like Shiba Inu, doge coin, baby doge etc due to his popularity those coins will get instant super growth in short time.

  

  

However, The success and price surge of Shiba inu is not just because of Elon Musk there are several factors involved like for any crypto coin "exchange" platforms play important role so when crypto coin listed in exchange then it can be traded but the exchange that the coin listed should have international presense, trust & popularity which leads any coin to heights.

  

Incase of Shiba Inu coin, it recieved superb attention and recognition from media and people around the world when Elon Musk tweet about it, due to that alot of people started purchasing Shiba Inu coin and to utilise this crowd and get profits many popular exchanges started listing Shiba Inu coin on thier platforms.

But, still some popular exchanges didn't listed Shiba Inu like Robin Hood so some people raised a PIL on change.org to list Shiba inu which now reached 5,06,112  signs with the goal of 10,00,000 signs, however there are even rumours about Shiba inu going to be listed on Shiba inu, no official confirmation of that anyway, all these petitions and rumours helped Shiba Inu to get tremendous surge in October 2021.

  

Shiba Inu coin is a crypto coin named out of popular japanese dog named Shiba, so Shiba inu also get support from dog lovers and Shiba inu carers. including that Shiba inu coin team do amazing marketing to rise the coin popularity and price, they even created thier own Shiba inu swap to trade or stake Shiba inu coin which is another reason behind the price surge.

  

If you invested in 1$ or 2$ in Shiba inu few months back then right now you'll get upto 7x to 8x price surge which means if you just invested 1 million few months back you probably be getting 8 millon today which is outstanding for a meme coin, all these because of Elon Musk, exchanges, good marketing skills and dog lovers.

  

Finally, The future of Shiba inu coin is very bright if everything goes well in place with  Elon musk & pet lovers support, Shiba inu could reach 1 cent by 2025 years if all exchanges list it early as possible, do you like it?
