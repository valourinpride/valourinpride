Symbian, a mobile operating system developed by Symbian Inc in 1998 for handheld PC also known as PDA aka personal digital assistant but later on after few years Symbian OS become best alternative to popular mobile operating system Java as at that time Nokia a well known top mobile manufacturing company developed SymbianOS even further to install on thier mobiles.

  

Eventhough, Java is most preffered mobile operating system of companies developed by Sun Microsystem still Symbian used to give tough competition to Java thanks to Nokia brand name with numerous regular developments surrounded by Geeks buzz but Symbian kicked out of league by new advanced and futuristic mobile operating systems from Apple and Google.

  

In 2007, Steve jobs founder of Apple launched world's first multi-touch smartphone with iOS and with-in year search engine giant Google also started launching smartphones with Android, while both iOS and Android are super advanced and powerful mobile operating systems in early days of smartphones.

  

Android is the main reason behind the downfall of Symbian and Java operating systems as Android is better open source mobile operating system most developers and companies were easily able to build and ship thier smartphones but incase of SymbianOS it's way behind and not even comparable to Android and IOS.

  

However, Nokia stubbornly used Symbian OS on it's keypad quality mobiles instead of Android even after knowing Android is more capable then old and outdated low Symbain or Java mobile operating system thus nokia mobile sells started dropping and eventually leaded them to losses.

  

Nokia even after getting huge losses due to outdated mobile operating system still didn't understand the potential of Android so they continued Symbian OS on keypad phones and partnered with Microsoft to launch it's Nokia lumia smartphones with Microsoft windows that is advanced and powerful but due to lack of proper support from Nokia and Microsoft for SymbianOS and Windows developers were unable to develop and release apps so SymbianOS and Microsoft Windows discontinued and joined the list of failed operating systems where TizenOS, MeeGO already exists.

  

While, Google and Apple continuously developing and providing regular updates and upgrades on thier mobile operating systems with proper route map for app developers to make best world class apps on thier mobile operating system thus Android and iOS used to get millions of apps everyday on thier own app market places like Play Store and App Store etc.

  

Anyhow, many people still like to use Symbian OS and it's apps or games for Nostalgia reasons and those who want to try Symbian OS usually buy Symbian OS phones or search for a method to install Symbian OS apps and games on Android or iOS powered smartphones but it's not possible due of different software and hardware with system limitations.

  

You can't directly Install Symbian OS apps on Android and iOS but fortunately we recently found a open source emulator named EKA2L1 that supports 64bit and 32bit experimental by using that you can install Symbian OS apps and games on Android via supported versions like S60v1, S60v2, and S60v5 and compatible devices like Nokia N Gage, 5320 and 5800 as of now isn't cool and interesting.

  

Actually, we have numerous Emulators available for Android to play almost any console video games like Lemuroid, Citra 3DS etc but few years back there is not even 1 Emulator available for SymbianOS thus most people who like to play Symbian OS games used to control themeselves by playing Java apps and games on J2ME Loader and PPSSPP emulator but now we have EKA2L1 to play Symbian OS games on Android, so do you like it? are you interested in EKA2L1? If yes let's know little more info before we explore more.
