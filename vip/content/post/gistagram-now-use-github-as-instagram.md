Everyday in society since ancient times people communicating with each other visually and verbally using various ways in different communication languages at first even now the primary way people like to communicate is through direct meetings and then next comes calls and SMS using mobile phones which let you communicate with fellow people you know wirelessly but thing is through regular calls and SMS you can't communicate effectively that's why a lot of people wanted alternative to them at that time we got digital technologies.

  

Software is basically digital technology developed using number of programming languages like C, C++, Python etc can be developed in two formats namely CLI aka command line interface and GUI aka graphical user interface which can be installed and run on supported electronic devices like PC and smartphones back in the early era of digital technology in order to communicate people used to CLI email based softwares but eventually as time goes many developers made way better communication softwares by adapting to latest technologies in that process we got modern CLI and GUI social networks.

  

We have many social network softwares which are way better than e-mail out of them almost all popular ones are GUI as most people like and prefer it over CLI anytime though now we have them as softwares packages but thing is in the beginning world's first social network named sixdegrees.com is a website on Internet which is basically online software after that many developers inspired by six degrees created their own social networks and published on Internet which are only accessible using world wide web browser but later on developers created package formats to install directly on devices.

  

In sense, in 21st century we have social networks available as websites on internet and software packages for PCs and smartphones which are widely used by large percentage of people around the world as right now most social networks provide many powerful and advanced options and features to communicate easily which are unavailable in Email and SMS by using social networks you can create personal or business portfolio after that you can connect with fellow people personally or through channels and groups etc anytime isn't that quite awesome?

  

Usually, most social networks have numerous similar options and features presented in different sytle templates but at the same time each social network try to do something special which makes it different from it's fellow competitors and other social networks like for Instance some social networks only allow you to publish text posts with restrictions and other may allow you to publish both text and digital media like photos and videos etc without limits based on requirements people choose such social network that works for them to communicate well.

  

Instagram is well known and popular social network at first created specifically to share photos on smartphones which worked for a lot of people mainly for mobile photographers who frequently like and want to share images online back then in early release like most social networks Instagram is basic but time to time development team added numerous accordindly as per the requirements and demands of users which now allows you to publish videos as well and become best alternative to several social networks like Tumblr, Twitter, Reddit, Pinterest etc.

  

GitHub is famous modern online contributive software development platform created for developers where users can create private and public repositories for software projects in which anyone through world wide web of internet can commit and contribute their code for the development of projects because of it's concept with flexibility and usefulness many people considered it as social network though it doesn't fit well in that category due to lack of right template but what if we can use GitHub with look and feel of Instagram, it will amazing right?

  

Recently, we got to know about an free and open source cross platform project named Gistagram inspired of Instagram which has UI and UX of Instagram due to that you will find GitHub repositories as image posts and comments as commits in style of Instagram including that almost all GitHub options and features integrated in Gistagram thus it look and feel something new and refreshing including that it also simplify usage of GitHub, so do you like it? are you interested?
