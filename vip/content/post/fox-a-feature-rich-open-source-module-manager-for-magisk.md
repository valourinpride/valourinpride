Software is basically developed using number of programming languages which are integrated on many electronic devices mainly PCs and smartphones in order to extend capabilities at present almost all PCs and smartphones are using GUI aka graphical user interface softwares known as operating system for instance to name few well known and popular ones Google's Android for smartphones when it comes to PCs we are used to Microsoft's Windows.

  

Eventhough, PCs aka personal computers with operating systems like Windows can do almost all real life tasks digitally and electronically but at the end they are big and not handheld devices so you can't easily carry and use them on move which is why from past one decade majority of people around the world using handheld smartphones which are mostly powered by Android, isn't that quite amazing?

  

Android is dominant foss aka free and open source operating system with more then 70% market share primarly available for handheld smartphones which provides transparency and security including that as it's open ecosystem you will be able to customize softwares very well but thing is for security and privacy system level files access is restricted on Android due to that you can't customize softwares extensively.

  

However, you can bypass Android restrictions and access system also known as root level files for that you have to unlock device bootloader and then flash custom recovery like TWRP aka TeamWin recovery project after that you have to install rooting softwares like SuperSu or Magisk but thing is all this process is bit hard and voids device warranty including that if you do anything wrong it can hard or softbrick device so if you're beginner then better to not do this to be in safe zone.

  

Meanwhile, on PCs you can simply click on run as administrator to access system level files but thing is now a days as said earlier large percentage of people relyed on Android smartphones out of them many people mainly geeks and techies rooting Android by following instructions from trusted platforms like XDA so that they can not just customize Android but also install custom Android softwares also known as roms to stay up to date.

  

SuperSu is well known and popular software to root Android devices developed by Chainfire but thing is it's creator stopped it's development in year 2017 and selled it to CCMT who released SuperSu 2.8.2 update root support for Android 7.0 since then there is no new majority updates of SuperSu due to that people were unable to root new Android devices at that time TopJohnWu released way better rooting software named Magisk which is best alternative to SuperSu.

  

Magisk is free and open source modern and feature rich software to root new Android version devices which is in costant development from TopJohnWu at present it is best root sofware that let you hide root for device and apps including that Magisk has inbuild repository for modules created by third party developers which can be flashed right from Magisk app but for whatever reasons TopJohnWu totally removed it on official Magisk.

  

Recently, we got to know an super cool free and open source third party Magisk module manager app with many options and features for Magisk rooted Android devices named Fox which was created as the official magisk removed and stopped support for it so if you are someone who was fond of module repository of Magisk then you'll enjoy Fox on the go, so do you like it? are you interested in Fox module manager, if yes let's explore more.
