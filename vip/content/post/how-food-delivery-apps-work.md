India have alot of different cultural and region's and food is one of the main thing that people have to take care to thier nativity.

  

Migration between states are normal as some go for study, some to live and some for job and regions have thier own taste natively.

  

To get fix this, many north indian foods and 

south indian hotels vice versa builded in cities, towns etc.

  

Being having different state people living in different cities for thier own reasons.

  

The restuarents and food chains increased very fast as it's not only being only south indian like pizza.

Swiggy to get into indian food companion they have to do something to get publicity and hype easily.

  

To get this, attractive offers will definitely do the job if something is worth more the money that they spend indian's customer will more choose.

  

Not only in india definately it will do work countries to but to get hype or publicity then something more than casual need be done as it takes very low if you go in normal prices but a less price and large crowd works like charm.

  

This thing not only Swiggy other apps to utilised slowly even being run in losses to catch the crowd and slowly expanded to other cities.
