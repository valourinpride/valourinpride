In 20th century, we are in modern era of millennials with many advanced technologies to name a few artificial technology and 3d augmented reality etc so in most cases you no more have to go outside to shop and work especially you can play most physical games digitally using gadgets like smartphones, desktop and video game consoles etc.

  

Nintendo, a popular japanese company known for video game consoles and Pokemon Go manufactured numerous consoles and developed 1000's of games over the years but as each console has different format games you have to first buy that specific video game console then load those format games supported by that Nintendo video game console to run games else it won't work.

  

Anyhow, now a days most people switched from video game consoles to PC and smartphones to play games still companies like Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft Xbox don't develop mobile emulators as it will drastically drop sells of thier products, but thanks to talented developers they are able to make un-official mobile emulators to play videos games on smartphones.

  

A decade back, gamers though playing video games on mobile is impossible but fortunately due to rapid development of mobiles we now have advanced mobiles known as smartphones with big display, ram, storage, processor etc to be able to support and play video games.

  

Eventhough, playing video games on smartphones is illegal as games are extracted from real video game consoles  and then they get uploaded on internet without permission from manufacturers yet most gamers love to play video games on smartphones using un-official mobile emulators over video game consoles.

  

Right now, we have number of unofficial mobile emulators for almost all video game consoles like Lemuroid - all in one emulator, PPSSPP and AetherSX2 emulator for Sony PSP 1 and 2, Citra Emulator to play Nintendo 3DS games etc and recently we found another amazing mobile emulator named Skyline to play Nintendo Switch video games.

However, mobile emulators are not easy to make as developers has no support from companies they have to do alot of things to support mobile software and hardware thus most heavy video game mobile emulators stay at alpha or beta stage for long time for instance Citra Emulator launched in 2018 but still in early access and same goes for Skyline even being open source projects on GitHub.

  

Skyline is best open source experimental  emulator that runs on ARMv8 Android™ devices and emulates functionality of Nintendo Switch but it's still in early access which means development is in progress so you may find bugs or limited number of features but eventually Skyline Emulator may fix all issues and release stable version with more interesting and exciting features in future, so do you like it? are you interested in Skyline Emulator?
