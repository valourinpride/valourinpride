YouTube from search engine giant Google is world's most popular renowned video blogging platform with millions of creators and videos, every day millions of people come and use YouTube to watch videos they like from numerous categories, so Google created many features and done alot of changes over the years on PC and mobile app to improve user experience of both creators and users.

  

Especially, In 2017 YouTube introduced a super cool feature named pip aka picture-in-picture mode which enable pop-up video mode so that you can watch videos in floating window and multi-task on PC or mobile, however pip mode is only available for free in united states so if want pip mode in other countries then you

have subscribe to YouTube premium that costs money every month.

  

YouTube for whatever reason seems not interested to provide pip support for free in countries like India, so users who can't afford YouTube premium subscription are relying on unofficial YouTube clients like YouTube Vanced, Newpipe, etc where they get all YouTube premium features for free.

  

Even though, Unofficial YouTube clients are illegal yet people use it as they are getting paid features for free but recently Google started focusing on unofficial YouTube clients and they even sent legal notices to YouTube vanced team and they shutdown saying everyone to use YouTube premium so unofficial YouTube clients are not reliable as Google can shutdown them.

  

However, If you just want pip aka pop video mode to watch videos in floating window then there one legal method which is VPN, all you have to do is connect to united states VPN to enable pip mode on official YouTube app for free without premium subscription.

  

In order to enable pip pop-up video for free using VPN then you have to select such VPN app which is reliable and actually has servers in united states not for name sake, we tried many VPN apps that has united states servers for example : ultrasurf VPN while most of them failed to enable pip mode on YouTube app except Windscribe.

  

Windscribe is amazing and fast VPN app that has numerous united states servers to instantly enable pip mode on YouTube app for free, but you only get 2gb data without signup and when you signup with email you will get 10gb data limit so if you want to extend data limit officially then you have to buy paid plans.

  

Note : this Windscibe VPN software mentioned here was developed by Google Play verified developers is available in public domain, we don't own and there is no connection with them, the Windscribe VPN when connected to United States of America cloud server is unlocking picture in picture YouTube video mode in any country, so we provided the information regarding it which is legal and comes under freedom of press including that people have full authority and right to use VPN softwares for privacy and security, if you are legitimate owner or official of YouTube and effected by this in any way we suggest you kindly contact Windscribe VPN to resolve matters, I just shown this method working process and structures, hope you mind it.
