There are many operating systems available available for smartphones out of them Apple's iOS and Google's Android are most popular and well known around the world while iOS is closed source operating which means no one else can use it and then comes Android an open source operating system due to that almost all mobile companies who were unable to use iOS started using Android to install on thier smartphones and sell globally.

  

Both iOS and Android competing with each other since year 2008 in almost all sectors of operating system especially in terms of privacy and security but Android provide way more features and customization in sense it provides free ecosystem where you can do almost anything even bypass system limitations by rooting which is why people like to customize smartphones go for Android over iOS anytime.

  

Even though, from past few years iOS also catching up to Android in customization but still alot of necessary and required features are missing on iOS which are available in Android since it's inception without rooting like you can install many third party home launchers then ultra customize widgets or  apps as you want to change look and feel of your Android powered smartphones.

  

Meanwhile, Apple inc. for whatever reason since it's early release don't allow you to install third party launchers because of that you have no choice other then to use stock launcher which is simple and cool and nostalgia with latest modern features timely but at one point you may get bored of iOS launcher and want to try something new at that time then there are many cool Android home launchers waiting for you.

  

We have numerous types of Android home launchers while stock ones from mobile companies are minimal they usually don't provide much customization options and features like iOS but there are numerous third party Android home launchers from alot of developers and companies that are specifically developed and designed to do heavy customization like pro.

  

Nova Launcher since long time known for ultra level customization of home screen which is packed with amazing features but over there you have to customize on your own each and every corner to get desired look and feel that's hard and take time including that Nova Launcher lack some features which are very much required by large percentage of Android users due to that they try other home launchers.

  

Even though, we have thousands of alternatives to Nova Launcher like Lawnchair, Hyperion and Poco Launcher etc which has it's own set of audience but most of them are simple and has almost same features and options with no much focus on home screen customization thus at the end they totally struggle to compete with Nova Launcher for sure.

  

Thankfully, there are Android home launchers which may don't provide features and options of Nova Launcher like Smart Launcher, Go Launcher and CMM launcher but has in-built custom home screen themes support which you can download and install in one tap to simply customize home screen like app icons, widgets and wallpapers etc so if you like that then you may try them.

  

However, most users of Android neither use Nova Launcher or theme based home launchers instead they like such type of home launchers which provide additional features that are unavailable in their stock launcher and Nova Launcher which is why Android developers constantly working on to bring new features that are accessible on home launcher of smartphones like live wallpaper and notification dots etc.

  

Fortunately, majority of popular Android home launchers including Nova Launcher since past decade continously working on to adapt and integrate latest features of Android upgrades in to home launchers which is amazing due to that you won't miss new things but most third party home launchers don't give features and options that are going come as an system upgrade on Android from Google in future.

  

You may say that Nova Launcher and other many other launchers already has features and options that may come in upcoming upgrades of Android that's true and they may release more but here's a catch recently we already found an futuristic home launcher that has alot of additional features that are not available on Nova Launcher and other stock Android home launchers, isn't interesting and exciting?

  

Ratio is privacy focused futuristic Android home launcher which provides no master key state-of-the-art asymmetric 256-bit RSA-based dual encryption to protect your data including that it has several potential features and options for less distraction, more focus, mindfulness and productivity which may not just come in Android but also on iOS in future, so do you like it? are you interested in Ratio : productivity home screen launcher?
