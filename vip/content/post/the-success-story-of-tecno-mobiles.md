You may heard of many value for money smartphones but have you ever heard of Tecno? Tecno is a subsidiary of chinese largest smartphone company Transsion holdings based in hongkong but Tecno's primary job and goal in intial phase is to uplift and mobilise people of developing countries like Africa, south east asia etc with thier affordable mobiles as in 2008 they shifted thier focus to African market.

  

Tecno mobiles gradually got tremendous attention from African people due to it's affordable prices and eventually become most popular smartphone brand in Africa, with the whooping success Tecno want to expand it's Tecno branded smartphones to other countries to make it a global brand and to achieve this they even made most famous "Captain America" fame actor Chris Evans as brand ambassador in 2021.

  

Eventhough, Tecno is now a global brand available in most countries that provides premium smartphones at very affordable prices but still Tecno smartphones didn't received attention from people around the world, while OnePlus and Xiaomi got alot of craze from the start itself, even in india most people don't even know about Tecno smartphones may be people were more occupied with smartphones from Xiaomi, Realme, etc.

  

However, Tecno is the only smartphone brand that can give tough competition and beat Xiaomi, realme smartphones interms of specifications, quality and low pricing, as Tecno provides high end features and top notch quality at budget friendly rates on every new Tecno series smartphones.

  

Tecno consistently releasing new series and smartphones every year with lowest price possible to win over competitors & gain customers but due to the effect of established smartphone companies like Xiaomi, Realme etc who revolutionized & changed the smartphone market in india and overseas yet Tecno strategically and slowly building it's presense all over the world to increase customers everyday.

  

Tecno don't rely much on advertisement like Xiaomi, so they will only get attention and recognition when thier product make buzz through public which will only happen when product is better then the rest, Tecno launched amazing smartphone series like camon, pova, phantom, etc which got alot of recognition & appreciation from geeks and customers.

  

Finally, Tecno has potential to play major role in global smartphone market, if they provide value for money smartphones in future as well including that Tecno already in the line to become top brand in india replacing Xiaomi, if they go in same pace in upcoming 5 years, so what do you think about Tecno? do you own tecno product? do mention your opinions in comment section below, see ya :)
