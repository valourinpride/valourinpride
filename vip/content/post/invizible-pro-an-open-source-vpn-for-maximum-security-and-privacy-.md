We are in digital world, every day millions of computers & mobile devices exploited by hackers for fun or personal gains so it is very important to safeguard and protect your data on your mobile devices else you may loose valuable data to hackers which may cause personal & career problems & yeah financial losses as well.

  

we have numerous VPN apps available for mobile devices either powered by Android or iOS but most of them are very basic and simple VPN apps which do provide little security but most general VPN apps don't have external features that can provide maximum security and privacy to the user which is surely a drawback.

  

In this scenario, we have a workaround we found an open source VPN app named InviZible Pro developed by Garmatin Oleksandr which uses DNSCrypt, Tor and Purple I2P to achieve maximum security and privacy, InviZible Pro not bloated with ads and unnecessary features.

  

InviZible Pro will get pure VPN usage experience but the only issue with InviZible Pro was it is currently only for Android which is little drawback but InviZible may soon available for iOS in future, do we got your attention?
