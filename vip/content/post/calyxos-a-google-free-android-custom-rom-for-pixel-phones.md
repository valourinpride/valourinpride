We have numerous mobile operating systems available out there on internet but Google's open source software Android and Apple's closed source iOS which is exclusively only available for iPhones are most popular ones even though Android has thrice higher market share all over the world as smartphones powered by Google Android are available for lowest price and has the potential to compete with iOS.

  

Even though, Apple's iPhone iOS is considered more secure due to closed software yet Google continuously working to improve Android security with regular security patches by fixing bugs and being open source system Android surely has advantage as anyone can review it's code and fix or report bugs to Google.

  

Google actually developed Android operating system exclusively for thier own smartphones known as Nexus devices which they changed name to Pixel and Google for whatever reason intentionally made it's Android operating system public by making it open source via Android open source project aka AOSP so that anyone can build thier own version of Android for thier smartphones for free.

  

Android open source project is well utilsed by companies to build thier own version of Android on thier mobiles for commericial purposes while alot of developers also build thier own custom version of Android naming them as custom roms for personal usages they even publish thier custom roms on portals like XDA.

  

At of time of building thier own version of Android software using AOSP both companies and developers can remove or add features they like and the main advantage of AOSP is you can make custom roms with upgraded software and updated security patches for old mobiles which stopped recieving OEM updates from thier mobile company.

  

Usually, smartphones companies stop providing OEM updates after 1 or 2 years as they want to make people buy thier new software for upgraded software, but not everyone can afford latest smartphones so they use old smartphone with outdated software that compromises security and privacy so to fix this problem many people install custom roms.

  

However, In order to install custom roms on Android smartphones you have to unlock bootloader and flash custom recovery like TWRP aka teamwin recovery project and then flash custom roms that are specifically developed for your device using guides that are specifically created for your devices from trusted portals like XDA which is risky as if you do anything wrong it will either hard or soft brick your smartphone which is irreparable and yeah it voids warranty anyway.

  

We have numerous custom roms build using AOSP or LineageOS which is known as CyanogenMod a fork of AOSP with little extra features, while most developers like to give stock experience on custom roms for optimisation and performance but we also have many custom roms that has alot of extra features with Google services.

  

Most custom roms come with Google services but some users don't like them as Android has alot of propieratary blobs that are not fully public thus it can cause privacy and security issues so for such people thankfully some talented developers created de-googled privacy focused Android custom roms like GrapheneOS, DivestOS, e/OS/ etc.
