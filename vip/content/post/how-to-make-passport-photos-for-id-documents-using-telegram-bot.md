There are numerous ways to see yourself isn't? like few centuries back people used to see themselves through pure water and mirrors or other crystal clear metals like gold or daimonds but they only show how you look at right moment in live not even hours or yesterday and few days back as it's not time machine or magic ball etc.

  

But, many skilled people in 18th century invented Pinhole camera a revolutionary machine or device build up of numerous hardware parts that can not just capture you but also physical real life objects around the world on paper in B/W aka black and white known as photographs in simple photos that with color compatible pinhole camers and tools can be captured and converted into color mode as well.

  

So, once you capture yourself or any other physical object in this world using Pinhole camera on compatible paper either it's B/W aka black and white or colour then you can see or show them if not damaged to fellow people even after years and centuries including that you can take print out of photos to give it to anyone like in consulates or offices etc even ask and print on local or international newspapers or stick on any places available in public sphere to show fellow people in your area or country and around the world.

  

Fortunately, In 19th century we got many such Pinhole cameras which can capture moving pictures known as films so if your photos are worth making films then you can do that as well but most people like and prefer to take photos as they are not only less expensive but also simple to show and get attention or recognition from any one in less time including that you can use photos in various ways not just giving them to fellow people but also showcase in your home or any other places even put and store in books as photo gallery etc.

  

The photos taken and displayed by you anywhere for personal or commercial reasons will show your identity or skills to grasp attention and recognition from viewers which is why photos are not just papers with right content in them they'll become most valuable assets globally.

  

Majority of people that's why learn to capture photos and those who already have skills and know how to capture professional photos are known as photographers they usually setup photo studios even without them capture photos of fellow people or any other real life objects then sell them to earn money and make business but majority of people capture photos of them or anything else casually or as part of hobby for free.

  

Thankfully, Pinhole cameras as time goes got alot of upgrades and improvements from inventors around the world due to that by mid 19th century they evolved to negetive reel cameras and then by year 1970s we got electronic digital cameras powered by batteries which provide alot options and features with hardware and software storage and memory to capture and store photos in digital format known as images at better resolution which you can see instantly without processing them in labs on PCs aka personal computers.

  

Now, In 21st century modern world of digital technologies we have most powerful digital cameras known as DSLRs even available on PCs and smarphones by using them you can not only capture photos but also films at high resolution with custom tunes and enhancements as per liking and preferences accordingly which is why majority of people no more using Pinhole or negative reels cameras instead shifted to digital cameras which are not only useful but also awesome.

  

Anyhow, since the era of Pinhone cameras itself photos are used in various ways and purposes in different sizes according to situation and scenario or work and purposes etc for instance when 2nd industrial revolution begin at that time to get jobs in factories people used to submit photos including that alot of people also wanted to go foriegn countries for various reasons and purposes via trains or ships and airplanes etc for that they must have to submit photos for verification purposes to concerned authorities and this process is still now widely used worldwide.

  

Usually, we now use 2×2 inch (51 mm x 51 mm size photos everywhere around the world in resumes mainly in passports to travel foriegn countries etc that's why they are popularly known as passport size photos so to get them most people go to photo studios as they have DSLR cameras and proper LED backlights with proper hardware and software technologies to capture high quality password size photos but what if we capture them on our own using smartphones it is possible now.

  

Even though, you can capture passport size photos yourself if you have skills using DSLR or smartphone even PCs cameras perfectly but not everyone does who may struggle or find hard do it for them recently we found an amazing bot named @PassportPhoto\_bot on popular powerful and advanced security and privacy centric social messaging platform Telegram which will simply job for you.
