Creativity is something that most people have in mind due to that they are able to think and make creative plans and things which look and feel different and better than normal ones such stuff has immense value worldwide as majority of people like to see and buy them which is why demand for creativeness and creators may not end atleast among people as since ancient times and now in modern society creative people given more value and ranked high than normal citizens as creative people are able to do revolutionary things which can improve and change world drastically.

  

Usually, each person have own creativity level based on various things mainly on IQ aka intelligence quotient even though thinking creatively for any creative person is easy but putting them into action is hard and difficult one based on the level of creativity and at the end unless creativity is presented in public domain it won't get recognition and value which is why many creators work and struggle to show their creativity to people around the world.

  

In sense, some creative concepts take very less time like minutes or hours and some take days or months even years or decades it's based mainly on capability of creator and available resources with him and outside world back in olden days due to lack of powerful and advanced digital and electronic technologies creators are unable to do creative things full fledgedly and effectively but now we have them due to that majority of creators are able to do all most all creative things efficiently.

  

Eventhough, in 21st century there are many modern technologies created by creative people so that anyone including creators can do things but out of them AI aka artificial intelligence is most popular and futuristic one which is basically a digital brain build up of neural networks with them and machine learning it can think and act on it's own based on existing data like human beings as programmed by creators which not just simplify tasks but also do them automatically very well.

  

AI is such modern technology which can execute tasks at maximum possible speed and accuracy because of amazing capabilities of AI to leverage them nowadays large percentage of people people widely using AI on different electronic and digital technology based products like on gadgets and softwares extensively to name few on camera apps of smartphones to capture better images and videos, robots to train them well and digital chat bots what not at present you'll find AI everywhere, isn't that amazing?

  

Especially, even to draw or make simple to complex art images and videos AI was utilised by a lot of people as you may know few years back in order to see your creative imagination in real world you either have to manually draw them on something or somehow make them and capture as image or video using camera right? but now you don't have to do all that process just simply send your creative imagination in keywords to AI in just few seconds or minutes it will automatically process and send arts accordingly.
