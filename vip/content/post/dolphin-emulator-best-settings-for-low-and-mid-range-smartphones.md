Home gaming consoles, have you ever heard of them? If yes you probably know Nintendo right? which is one of the most popular and best home video game console company existed since decades that made several home video gaming consoles even though Sony PlayStation home gaming consoles are much more modern and advanced thus everyone like to use them yet there are many gamers who like to use old Nintendo gaming consoles for Nostalgia reasons.

  

We have number of home gaming consoles and each of them has different format games thus you can't play 1 game on another as home gaming console don't support it for various technical reasons,  however the era of home video gaming consoles eventually decreased as people around the work got thier hands on PC - personal computers that used to have basic features but gradually personal computers become modern with powerful hardware and software to play almost all high graphic games.

  

But, when smartphones entered into mobile market in 21st century of Gen-Z and millennials most people who got used to keypad phones and personal computers aka PCs to multi-touch smartphones that are small and user-friendly with powerful hardware and software to do almost all tasks of PC in it's own way thus most people like to use smartphones over personal computers.

  

Eventhough, Personal computers have more powerful and advanced softwares then that of smartphones even now yet as smartphones over the years gone through numerous updates they are now become modern smartphones which are capable to store big files even install and run heavy resource softwares and games etc.

  

Fortunately, there are millons of games available for personal computers and smartphones on various platforms that most people like and use but some gamers especially those who like home gaming consoles demand and want to play home console video games on computers or smartphones.

  

Few years back, it is not possible to play home console video games on personal computers and smartphones due to different hardware and software with system limitations but eventually alot of developers created numbers of home gaming consoles emulators to play video games on PCs and smartphones.

  

Most video game emulators created for PCs and smartphones are unofficial build by third party developers who are not associated with home consoles makers thus third party developers don't get any support for thier video game emulator projects due to that third party developers very likely have to work super hard and spend alot of time in-order check alot of things to make hardware and software compatible home video game console for emulator for PCs especially on smartphones.

  

Modern PCs have powerful hardware and software like home gaming consoles thus it's not hard for developers to create home video gaming consoles emulators for PCs but as modern smartphones don't have PC or home gaming console level hardware and software thus it's bit hard to play video games on smartphones, that's why majority of video game emulator available for smartphones stay at early access or beta phase even being open source projects on GitHub or GitLab etc.

  

Usually, when you play big video games on early access emulators using low or mid range smartphones you will most likely face glitches and lags etc but thankfully most developers who create video game emulators include advanced settings thus you can change and set according to your smartphone capacity to play video games on smartphone without issues.

  

Anyhow, home gaming console makers don't make video game official emulators for computers and smartphones as it will drop sells of thier existing products so it's illegal to use unofficial emulators as you have to download and load pirated version of video games also known as roms from internet that are extracted from real home gaming consoles then uploaded them on online portals without permission but still people like and prefer unofficial emulators over expensive home gaming consoles.

  

Recently, we found best settings for Dophin Emulator that can play Nintendo Wii and GameCube video games on smartphones but dolphin emulator official version can't utilise this best settings to full potential so few developers created few unofficial variants of official dolphin emulator that was optimized and has more settings and optimized to provide more fps rate.

  

Dolphin emulator MMJR variant developed  by Bankaimaster999 and Gamer64ytb seems to provide better fps rate then the official version thus you can set the best settings that we provide below for more improved fps to get smooth gameplay experience, so do you like it? are you interested in Dolphin Emulator MMJR? If yes let's know little more info to explore more.
