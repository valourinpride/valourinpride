Electronic devices are now widely used around the world out of them most people use and note them as favourite are PCs aka personal computers and smartphones isn't it? as they not just have powerful and advanced modern hardware but also able to install and run digital softwares created using number of programming languages like C, C++, Python etc on processor then show up on monitor screen display with them you can execute almost all real life tasks electronically and digitally.

  

The primary reason why most people purchase PCs and smartphones are because of it's ability to install offline softwares and mainly to access public online softwares on Internet using browser which is another software that will do this job but do you know when exactly this usage of browser begin? It's in year 1991 when Tim Berners Lee created world's first browser named World Wide Web inshort WWW after that number of Inventors with their own changes and improvements made different amazing browsers.

  

WWW is able to access hosted public contents of internet which is revolutionary as since 1969 when internet is created by ARPANET from then it is used to be private and only able to send and receive digital messages between computers that was changed with the entry of WWW as that was access hosted online softwares that are in form of websites and blogs a lot of people started developing them in order to access on WWW using PCs very well.

  

If you don't know what exactly is internet then for you in simple Internet is basically network of computers, it is an standard protocol known as Internet protocol inshort IP that assigns unique IP address to each PCs or smartphones and other electronic devices like Smart TVs and smartwatches then move digital data on network between them due to that we are able to send digital messages and also publicly host websites and blogs etc.

  

The websites and blogs in the start of first WWW browser are quite basic as most developers got used to one programming language which is html aka hypertext programming language but eventually as web of internet keep on updating and upgrading in that process we got Web 2.0 by then people started using number of programming languages like CSS, PHP, JavaScript etc to make modern versions of them which are surely super cool.

  

Now, we are in Web 2.0 era like few decades back we still use electronic devices hardware storage and memory to create virtual centralized server then use it as a bridge to host digital data on internet that are also virtually provided through websites known as cloud servers but from past few years we are moving towards upgrading Internet to Web3 where we use decentralized servers provided by people worldwide due to that eventually Web3 decentralized internet is future.

  

Web3 is better then Web2.0 as in Web3 digital data is divided into numerous parts and encrypted then hosted on IPFS aka interplanetary file system decentralized servers provided by numerous companies or individuals around the world including that Web3 digital data use Web3 domains that use crypto blockchain technology due to all of them they're not just censorship resistant but also run with no down time providing best security and privacy.

  

Domain is basically url aka uniform resource locator also known as link that you attach with digital data to access on internet using browser which is in digital form in numericals using centralized DNS aka Domain name server it can convert to 

human readable text format but they are centralized so can be controlled by certain authorities which is not good so to fix this and get more freedom on internet we got Web3 domains which uses decentralized DNS with blockchain crypto technology to connect and publish decentralized Web3 content on internet super securely.

  

Anyhow, you use any Web version of internet the thing is in order to access it's public contents on Internet at present you need mobile or WiFi data which are usually provided by Telecom and broadband or optical fiber providers who generate blank data memory then using base stations or satellites through radio waves transmit it to receivers of electronic devices for some price and paid subscriptions with limits and restrictions then you can use them to access anything on Internet using WWW.

  

Now a days, mobile data provided through sim cards and WiFi or optical fiber data provided through modems worldwide is priced average at affordable rates even cheap in many countries which though large percentage of people use on daily basis extensively but not everyone use it including that If you don't have mobile or WIFI for whatever reasons due to validity expiry or anything else then you can't use internet at that time the only option that're available for us are calls and SMS.

  

Generally, PCs don't come with Telecom based calls and SMS but telephone and PDAs aka personal digital assistant evolution smartphones comes with both voice based calls and text messages using SMS communication technologies which are by default provided by sim cards and don't need mobile or WiFi data though it can provide mobile data parallelly.

  

Usually, SMS aka short messaging services is mainly used by many people to send and receive quick responses from fellow people isn't it? but the thing is with them you only receives information sent by someone or company other then that you can't really do much with them, what if we can browser web over SMS it will be interesting and super useful right?

  

In sense, telecom sms not that you get on social messaging softwares which require mobile or wifi data compulsory, the speciality here with browsing web over SMS is something new concept and it's working way is also fascinating as here you'll sent search key words over sms and then recieve the result the result through SMS so there should be someone in other side who have to send it for you, gotcha?

  

Especially, Internet browser over SMS is not easy and technical as well as SMS only able to receive 70 bytes of data so the html data provided by websites and blogs etc have to be compressed very much then only reciever will get full information including that sending and receiving messages costs money so the otherside electronic device or person can't let you browse web over sms for free unless they have free toll free number to do this.

  

Recently, we got to know about an foss aka free and open source Android app named TextNet Browser which is inspired of Cosmos Browser that allows anyone to you browse web of internet over SMS provided in unencrypted plaintext by server without mobile and wifi data that uses SMS as a medium of transmitting HTTP requests to a server where a pre-parsed HTML response is compressed using the Google's Brotli compression algorithm and encoded using a custom Base-114 encoding format based on Basest, isn't that fantastic?

  

Note : TextNet Browser as on November 14 it's core functionality is temporarily not available as it uses Twilio phone number credits are over but in future the issue can be resolved completely, but one thing that you have keep in mind before going with TextNet Browser it is currently only available for united states as it uses that country number to provide this services, so do you like it? are you still interested?
