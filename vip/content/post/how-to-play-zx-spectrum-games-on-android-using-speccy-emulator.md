Now a days we are playing hd - high graphic video games but back in 1960s few decades back computers used to be big as car to run simple moving graphic game at first in year 1962 Steve Russell of MIT developed world's first digital video game named Space War which is basically a software to run on computer.

  

Fortunately, after SpaceWar in span of few years numerous developers created many more digital video games using various programming languages in that process we got better quality moving graphic video games but in order to install and run them you need computer which is expensive.

  

In sense, computer is not home compatible and affordable thus not everyone able to get them but the interest to play computer digital games exists so after few decades in year 1971 inventors Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney created and released world's first commercial arcade machine named Computer Space that will let you play digital video games.

Computer Space was expensive developed for offline store and gaming saloons with pay and use model where people have to drop pre-set amount of money coins to play certain amount of time due to that alot of people especially teens and kids started using it wherever it's available to play computer digital games but back then Computer Space failed commercially.

  

However, the template and technologies left by Computer Space was later utilised by number of companies with necessary required advancements and improvements to make thier own version of arcade video game machines due to that eventually we got modern arcade video game machines but at the end they're not designed to be home compatible unless you have huge free space and maintainence expenses.

  

Thankfully, In year 1972 company Magnavox developed and released it's world's first home video game console named Odyssey which occupy less space that can be simply connected to television to play supported system video games any where and anytime at your convenience in comfort zone after that many companies globally started making thier own version of home video game consoles.

  

There are different hardware and software home video game consoles due to that eventually majority of arcade video game machine users shifted to home video game consoles because of it's flexibility but home video game consoles does have few drawbacks like you can't do anything else other then playing video games and television is must which provides display monitor to show moving graphics due to that it's not suitable for everyone.

  

Even though, TV- television is easy to use but usually it is mostly only available in homes so in case you don't have or like to use television or don't like to connect to external monitor through rbg cables for whatever reasons then they may won't work instead you have to try out digital computers which provides in-build monitor display with keyboard to install and play all your cool video game softwares.

  

But, computers are not gaming centric you can alot more stuff and they are pretty big and expensive as well so many inventors for personal or commercial reasons since begginings reduced the size and price of computer by creating or adapting to new technologies in that process we got PCs aka personal computers also known as home and micro computers.

  

PCs are home compatible which occupy less space to fit anywhere like on top of table but at the end they are small replica of big computers so it's not suitable for those especially kids and teens who just want to play video games without distractions like on home arcade machines and gaming consoles for them many companies developed and released only gaming personal computers.

  

We have numerous gaming focused personal well known as home or micro computers back in time out of them ZX Spectrum is one which is an popular 8 bit personal home computer developed by 

Sinclair Research released in the United Kingdom on 23 April 1982 and become Britain's best-selling micro computer.

  

However, PCs over the years gone through alot of advancements adapting to latest technologies timely thanks to competion among companies in this capitalist world that eventually leaded to powerful hardware and advanced software to not only install and manage to run heavy resources softwares but also HD - high definition and resolution moving graphics amazing digital video games.

  

Modern computers come with big storage and memory to store huge size games and softwares with awesome useful features and extensive flexibility due to that almost everyone now use modern computers to do various tasks and play video games but there are certain percentage of people who out of curiosity or nostalgia reasons still want to play classic retro video games on old personal home micro computers.

  

Unfortunately, majority of companies long time ago stopped making and selling old only gaming personal computers so if you want video games of them then you may can't get new ones instead there are few websites where you can buy old ones but availability is not guaranteed as they are rare and worth preserving items.

  

The rare gaming personal home computers are super expensive that you may only buy if you are an collector and have enough money to spend on but in case you just want to buy them to play old games then it's not worthy as now we are in 21st century of modern PCs and smartphones which are capable enough to play almost all old personal home computer video games through emulator softwares.

  

Emulator softwares are mostly created by third party developers thus they are considered as unofficial but PCs and smartphones can't directly run old personal home computers digital video games due to hardware and software differences which is why they develop emulator in supported digital format of using various compatible programming languages then implement and emulate old personal home computer hardware in emulator softwares.

  

In sense, un-official emulators provide an digital environment on software of old personal home computer where you can sideload and run games basically like an operating system or Virtual Box etc. which is super hard and take time that's why alot of latest unofficial emulators stay in early access or alpha and beta phase for long time like few years, disappointing isn't?

  

The reason behind slow progress in development of unofficial emulators is third party developers are not associated with old home video game computers thus they don't get any support in making unofficial emulators due to that they have to manually write code to create and check files from scratch with heavy testing and debugging to find and fix bug fixes reported by users while playing personal home computer videos games.

  

Thankfully, since more then a decade third party developers to multiply development speed of unofficial emulators releasing thier code as free and open source projects via public respositories on contributive development platforms like GitHub and GitLab etc where anyone on web can register and commit thier code to improve and optimise software and add or remove options and features etc due to that we are getting stable versions of unofficial emulators in less time.

  

Majority of unofficial emulators are free and open source software which is another advantage so that anyone can use it to build custom unofficial emulators with further necessary optimizations and enhancements due to that now there are many offlcial and unofficial clients and ports of PC unofficial emulators for smartphones and vice versa.

  

We are widely using hand held smartphones around the world that came to replace keypad mobile phones which are user friendly still some of the PC unofficial emulators are unsupported due in capable hardware and software but numerous companies upgrading and advancing smartphones timely so in future we will support more latest unofficial emulators for sure.

  

Third party developers usually concentrate on developing unofficial emulators for PC as they have potential and capable hardware and software to load and manage to run modern video games but due to demand and smartphones also can almost all tasks of PC in it's own third party developers porting PCs or making new unofficial emulators for smartphones.

  

Anyhow, In case of Sinclair ZX Spectrum  personal home computer they are old and basic due to that third party developers already build many stable unofficial emulators with numerous options and features for PCs and smartphones as they are capable enough to play any old classic old gaming only personal home computer games at ease for free.

  

Recently, we found an free and open source unofficial emulator for Android powered smartphones named Speecy ZX spectrum emulator that can play old video games written in Spectrum 16k, 48k, 128k, +2, +2A, +3, Timex Sinclair, Sam Coupe, Pentagon and Skorpion personal home computers, so do you like it? are you interested?
