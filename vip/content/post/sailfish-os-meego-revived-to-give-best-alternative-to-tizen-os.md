Sailfish OS is a Linux based operating system like Android OS developed by Jolla for Jolla phones, many people who don't know Sailfish OS may think it was based on Android OS as alot of custom roms are actually based on Android OS but incase of Sailfish OS it was evolution of MeeGO OS which was previously developed by intel and nokia but later discontinued.

  

Nokia N9 is the first smartphone to ship with MeeGo OS out of the box in 2011, but MeeGo OS failed like Microsoft Windows and Firefox OS as back in 2011 people are more interested in Android and IOS as they are getting Android powered smartphones at cheaper price with better features over  MeeGO OS anytime.

  

Linux foundation itself favored Samsung Tizen OS and discontinued MeeGo OS in 2011, anyhow the legacy of MeeGo OS is still in continuation with Sailfish OS that can be used on smartphones, smart TV's, in vehicle infotainment IVI navigation and desktops, notebooks, yachts, automotive, e-commerce, home appliances, measuring and control equipment, equipment, smart building etc.

  

Even though MeeGo OS don't support Android apps but Sailfish OS has Android apps compatibility which is why numerous developers build Sailfish OS custom roms using it's open source repository to make it work on Android powered smartphones, fortunately many Android smartphones able to boot Sailfish OS.

  

You can install Sailfish OS unofficially only on those smartphones which has Sailfish OS custom roms else it won't possible unless you have officially supported devices like Sony Xperia™ 10 II, Xperia 10 and 10 Plus, Xperia XA2, XA2 Plus and XA2 Ultra, and Xperia X, planet computers Gemini PDA with Sailfish X downloadable version of Sailfish OS.
