Keyboard, a revolutionary invention that not only changed the way we do things but it also become important thing in our life as you may know keyboard is basically a hardware device with alphabets from a to z and numbers from 1 to 9 including that there are many more things which all are known as commands required to connect and communicate with computer or other electronic devices by using them you can make connected devices perform various different tasks electronically and digitally based on it's integral technologies.

  

In sense, keyboard is bridge between you and electronic devices though you can also use mouse pointer but it's very much limited to GUI aka graphical user interface operating system based devices when it comes to keyboard it can be used on CLI aka command line operating system as well as on GUI ones which is why experts recommend beginners to control and get used to keyboards over mouse pointer to do all things so that they'll be flexible and able to do tasks quickly and efficiently.

  

There are several keyboard types created by number of inventors around the world after doing a lot of R&D aka research and development on arrangements of key words to make them user-friendly and convenient for users though there are numerous keyboards but the one that most people immensely using from past few decades is ergonomic design qwerty keyboard which is why majority of people to go as per trend like and prefer to learn that over others, are you one of them?

  

The main goal of inventors in making of keyboards is to make your interactions and typing on whatever electronic devices quicker though qwerty keyboard is well known and popular one but not everyone is comfortable with it due to various reasons for Instance some people don't use qwerty instead they choose such keyword which ever is convenient for typing according to their size of fingers and personal preference on arrangements of keywords, numbers commands etc.

  

Eventhough, there are some proffesional typists and people who use and say even argue and recommend stating and highly suggesting that Dvorak keyboard is way better and comfortable than qwerty which as per them increases speed as well as accuracy thier words have value as the world's fastest typer Barbara Blackburn even use and made world record using Dvorak keyboard but thing is majority of people globally use qwerty due to that most developers and companies created qwerty keyboard learning softwares.

  

Nowadays, most keyboard learning softwares available for computers are qwerty based ones out of them some include Dvorak as well which is quite acceptable and understandable but thing is as said earlier there are several types of keyboards though they have quite small userbase including that even qwerty itself have different versions which are widely used in different countries yet mostly not provided by many cool keyboard learning softwares like to few JIS in Japan, Azerty in French etc, isn't that dissapointing?

  

Typing Master is well known and popular feature rich software to learn typing yet still not everyone like to use it though it has several games but at the end it's only available for PCs and it's not much attractive and gripping one which is why a lot of people learn and test their typing skills using online websites or find and use alternative softwares which are way better and works best for them to pratice qwerty or Dvorak typing on the go.

  

Recently, we got to know about an no ads super fun and entertaining offline cross platform feature rich typing learning software named Typing Land filled with around 81 lessons as of now available for smartphones which offers Dvorak and different types of qwerty keyboard including that you can directly use on pc or simply load app on emulators even just connect keyboard with smartphone via hdmi, so do you like it? are you interested in Typing Land?
