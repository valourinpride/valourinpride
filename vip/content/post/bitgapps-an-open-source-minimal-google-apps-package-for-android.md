In stock roms, smartphone manufacturers usually install full package of Google Apps on AndroidOS in-addition they also include thier own set of OEM - system apps which most people feel them as bloatware, even when users try to uninstall those apps it's not possible as they are system apps, this is why people root and unlock bootloader of smartphones in-order to install custom roms and unlock full capable functionality, anyhow it voids your warranty.

  

The issue with full Google Apps package that you usually find in stock roms is they consume alot of storage and ram with so many unnecessary apps that are actually not required by majority of Android users, so this fix issue we got alternative GApps aka Google apps packages from sources like Open GApps where you can get many different variants Google apps package created by developers for custom roms.

Open GApps is an open-source project where you will get Google Apps packages in different variants for Android 5.0 to 11.0 versions like aroma, super, stock, full, mini, micro, nano, pico, tvstock, tvmini etc while people who want full Google apps depend on Super and those who require small size and minimal Google Apps package use Pico.

  

Recently, we are in-search for GApps package that is more small in size and  minimal then Open GApps Pico Variant, fortunately we're glad to found minimal build GApps named BiTGApps which is between 80 - 90MB package size with advanced and additional features.

  

BiTGApps is an [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) and [open source project](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) that does not come in several variants instead it has only one variant came into existence in 2018 created by TheHitman7 to provide simple, optimized, tweaked, no bloatware and perfectly balanced GApps for custom roms which is neither a fork of GApps nor based on existing Google Apps packages, so do you like it? are you ready to explore more? If yes let's begin.
