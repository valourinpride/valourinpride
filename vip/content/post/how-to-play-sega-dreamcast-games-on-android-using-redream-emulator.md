Earth, on this blue planet with billions of living organisms human beings are one of them who has more intellectual and smart brain then any other creature in this world known so far human beings continuously inventing and developing many products to make life of mankind simple and safe using various methods especially in this era of technology with amazing gadgets for example : prior 1970s people used to play physical games but later on we got home video gaming consoles by using them you can start playing games on digital screen from indoor spaces.  

  

There are numerous home video game consoles out there on market while most of them discontinued for various reasons and fortunately few of them got success like Sony PlayStation and Nintendo they are still in continuation but even though most video home video game consoles discontinued yet there are many people who like to play them.

  

It is possible to buy old discontinued home video game consoles from online market but it's not worthy as in 21th century we have modern smartphones and personal computers - PCs with powerful hardware and advanced software which can play majority of home console video games using unofficial emulators.

  

Modern PCs and smartphones can't directly Install and run home console video games on it's desktop or mobile operating system as there is no official support due to different software and hardware with system limitations but as emulators are apps and softwares it is possible to run home console video games.

  

Home gaming console makers usually don't create official emulators to play video games on PC or smartphone as it will drop sells of thier existing products thus we have to use unofficial emulators build by third party developers who don't get any support from home video game console makers so without any choice third party developers have to create and check alot of files to make smartphone and PC compatible unofficial emulator.

  

Unofficial video game console emulators for PC and smartphones are not easy to make as third party developers have to go through alot of things which is super hard and takes time that's why most unofficial emulators stay at early access phase for years even being open source projects on platforms like GitHub or GitLab etc.

  

PCs have more powerful hardware and advanced software then smartphones so unofficial emulators better support and first available for PCs but thankfully when 

modern smartphones entered in mobile market most people switched to them as smartphones are user friendly and can do almost works of PC in it's own way.

  

Especially, now a days people using smartphones over PCs thus the demand for video game emulators is at peak so developers to full the requirements of people and gamers started developing and porting home video game emulators from PC to smartphones but you can run one home console video games on another unless you use all in one video game emulator like Lemuroid.

  

However, if you want to use unofficial emulators legally you have to dump BIOS and games from real home video game consoles that you own else you have to download pirated version of BIOS and games from internet that are extracted from real home video game console and uploaded on websites that is illegal but still people like to use unofficial emulators over home video game consoles.

  

Recently, we found an emulator named Redream that can play Sega's last and discontinued Dreamcast home console video games on smartphones so do we got your attention? are you interested in redream emulator ? If yes let's know little more info before we explore more.
