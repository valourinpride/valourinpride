When smartphones didn't existed computers are the only devices that are available to people since decades even now computers usually have more powerful hardware and software then smartphones including that computers have millions of softwares that are more capable and advanced then smartphones.

  

Now a days, majority of people switched to smartphones as you can do almost all works of PC on smartphones in its own way but there are some functions and softwares of computers that are not available on smartphones like for instance you can directly install computer softwares on smartphone mobile operating systems due to different hardware and software limitations.

  

Even though, now we have computer emulators like Limbo and ExaGear by using them you can install computer operating systems and softwares on smartphones yet they are slow and can only Install limited softwares so people not showing much interest on computer emulators instead they opting to cloud softwares and desktop operating systems like OnWorks and Never Install.

Recently, we found some commands to install and run VS Code aka Visual Studio Code a popular desktop software released by Microsoft on November 18, 2015 which is very popular and reliable software that is used by majority of developers to code, view code and debug softwares etc.

  

There are numerous mobile VS Code apps available for smartphones but still desktop VS Code is more powerful and capable thus if you want complete IDE software for professional usages then VS Code is right choice and fortunately you can also run VS code on smartphones using Termux.
