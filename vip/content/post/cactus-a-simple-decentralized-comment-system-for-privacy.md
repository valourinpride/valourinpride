Comment system is essential and adds extra value for any blog where users can comment to ask questions, give opinions even help fellow users by clarifying doubts etc, that's why many bloggers implement thier own custom comment system but majority of bloggers depend on third party advanced comment systems like Discord, Graphcomment etc.

  

Third party comment systems offer advanced features with better and detailed insights on user comments compared to default comment system provided by content management systems like blogger, WordPress etc thus you're able to use them for marketing purposes or study them to understand your visitors and improve your user interactions.

  

Even though, third party comment systems provide cool and amazing features yet the problem with them is they are managed by company on centralized server which are prone to hacking, as centralized servers use single server hackers can exploit server to extract userdata and they sell them to advertising agencies or publish them online that can cause privacy issues.

  

Now a days most people using platforms that are based on centralised server, anyhow we are slowly upgrading to Web3 a decentralized internet where websites and files are divided into parts and then hosted on numerous decentralised servers that are provided by unknown individuals around the world so no one hack and access user database.

  

Decentralized servers provide best speed, stability and no down time as your data is distributed to numerous servers thus you will get privacy and security, fortunately we already has several decentralized platforms out there on internet like dVPN, DeFi, crypto currency, cloud storage, social networks, websites etc.
