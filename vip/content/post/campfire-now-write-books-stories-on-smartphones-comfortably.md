Since, ancient times on earth we human beings known as people in modern society were able to express our thoughts in vocal languages and then eventually we got idea to show vocal languages in written forms at first on rocks, metals like iron using any hard material like chesels or rocks etc and then on leafs and books using colours that immensely helped to share and spread any topic knowledge globally.

  

Majority of people who want to show thier knowledge of any matter either skills or stories for personal or commercial reasons mainly used to write on books or newspapers to show mass audience of any geo-location regarding anything easily due to that writing become powerful and necessary tool for communication and  employment purposes as well.

  

Fortunately, the value of written languages was recognised around the world which is why almost all countries in pre-modern government era itself setup small and big  educational institutions with eligible gurus and teachers to teach people on how to express vocal languages in written form since age 6 that may change according to time based on universal or country own spiritual and constitution laws etc.

  

In year 1980s and prior almost all writers used to depend on books and newspapers to show thier writings worldwide that created a market for them so alot of people to make business opened stores and libraries to sell or provide free or paid access to books of any category beside the writer orgin and ethnicity thanks to free speech and equality in modern world.

  

When people around the world used to only have few primary sources like books and newspapers to get entertainment and also gain knowledge through written form languages and drawings at that time we got electronic computers evolved to PCs - personal computers in year 1970s which are equipped with digital softwares build using number of programming languages can do any real life physical actions tasks of people electronically and digitally.

  

Thankfully, many developers around the world created numerous revolutionary different computer softwares of almost all categories to do designed tasks according to requirements in that process we got 

e-books aka electronic books at the same time e-book reader softwares to view them which as time goes considered as an best replacement to physical object like books.

  

E-books are created using computer softwares known as E-Book creator or editor softwares with the assistance of keyword either it's qwerty or any other by using it you can type your written language in text format on digital E-book pages and then parse all together to make full E-book that you can simply share for personal or financial reasons through computers.

  

Even though, majority of writers taken few decades to adapt to trend of e-books but  large percentage of popular and new writers by year 1990s begin making e-books mainly since the entry of world wide web browser software of internet that created an world wide market for e-books so many business mans and writers to get fame and money opened alot of free and paid amazing e-book stores.

  

WWW aka world wide web is revolutionary computer software created by Tim Berners Lee in year 1991 allows you to open public contents of Internet which is an standard protocol developed by ARPANET to move digital data between computers on network at first in year 1969 used for communication by sending digital sms  then later on it was turned to many other digital platforms known as websites due to world wide web in that process we got many internet based digital online digital e-book stores useful right?

  

E-book digital files and website based stores roaming on Internet accessible on world wide web using url aka uninform resource locator also known as link basically domain address increased the reach of e-books including that in year 1990s and 2000s many companies by understanding the potential of E-books manufactured electronic products known as E-Book which are quite awesome.

  

Most people use computers to read and create or edit e-books so e-book reader electronic devices didn't got big hit until Amazon Kindle which also didn't got wide attention and recognition from people as they already have much better and best alternative known as smartphones that came to replace keypad mobile phones which are evolution of Telephones.

  

Amazon Kindle is basically an evolved version of smartphones known as tablets with big screen thus it will better to read e-books but as time goes once small size 3 to 4 inch smarphones now has big size 6 to 7 inches which is why no one caring much about e-book device readers instead completely using smartphones.

  

Smartphones can do almost all tasks of PC in it's own way which is why now people use it more then PCs that's why you'll find all types of softwares including e-book related ones where you can simply download and install e-book reader apps to read any format e-books easily.

  

Usually, back in time in 1970s it was not easy to create e-books especially big and complex ones at that time they have to do alot of back end work hard to get every thing right on computer as it used to be basic with less options and softwares like notepads and text files but later on by year 1990s we got modern e-book creators and editors to make e-books quickly.

  

There are alot of e-book creators and editors also available on smartphones as  writers switched to it to write new E-books from scratch or scanning and convert an existing physical book to digital e-book on then the go conveniently and comfortably due to that now we have millions of useful  ebooks on world wide web which you can search to get and read comfortably.

  

If you're writer and want to make brand new e-book on smartphone over PC then it's important to select right one because it should get you through the start to end in making best possible e-book according to you isn't that's why choose and use some e-book creators after that pick best one out of them so you'll have no regrets.
