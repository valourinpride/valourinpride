Unified, means being together either it's the people or products and services etc if they're in one place you'll be able to get or reach them not just quickly but also quite conveniently and comfortably, incase you have anything that scattered in number of different places then it is bit difficult and take time to access them isn't it? which is why in most scenarios it's better to unify certain things thus you'll be able to work more productively and efficiently.

  

Wherever you go in this world in many fields and sectors you'll find unification of things in different manners for various purposes like for instance governments unify number of it's existing schemes into one new scheme so that people in simple were able to get benefits and incase of telecom networks over there as well you'll find unification like calls + messages and Integration of many value added services to ease communication extensively.

  

Especially, In electronic devices like PCs aka personal computers and smartphones which are basically hardware but on top of that software developed using number of programming languages is Integrated thus you are able to access digital technologies isn't that super cool? that's why majority of people and companies since long time to simplify and advance trying and unifying both hardware and digital technologies.

  

In sense, now a days you will find unification of various things worldwide which for sure increasing efficiency for people in number of ways immensely but not everytime in some cases unification of people or products and services may work without unification better like for instance it's better to not unify good and bad things in one place the more seperate they'll stay the more people will be in safe zone.

  

Incase of communication technologies, as per current trends and requirements of people the more we can unify them the more people can communicate with fellow people around the world effectively but currently many digital technologies are not unified like social messenger softwares as each one of them are created by different developers or companies isn't it?

  

Majority of PC or smartphone social messaging software developers usually don't unite for various different personal or commercial reasons mainly because they want to keep their technologies private and make business themselves due to that people have no choice other then to use numerous social messsanger softwares for communication accordingly.

  

We have amazing powerful and advanced social messaging softwares for PCs and smartphones with many different modern options and features with various levels of use cases which operate individual or with partnered entities but one thing which is common in them is they are basically used to send and receive voice or video digital calls and messages isn't that right? 

  

What if we can unify social messengers not in software level that's not possible unless the developer mutually make contract or partnership publicly or privately but just in simple get all of their messages in one software and then access or operate them that work like charm which is why many skilled developers mainly from past few years developed amazing unified messengers for both PCs and smartphones etc.

  

Meanwhile, there are some social messaging softwares which are specifically designed and developed for particular operating systems and electronic devices like for Instance if you're an iPhone user then you probably know iMessage which is closed source and made only for iOS smartphones but what if you decided to change to some other operating system like Android then in simple as iMessage is not available for Android so you can't access in them.

  

Google's Android is well known and most popular free and open source operating system for smartphones and other electronic devices where you do get number of fantastic social messaging softwares but what if for whatever reason you want Apple inc. iMessage on Android then also it's not possible unless you use any screen mirror from iPhone isn't it?  

  

Generally, most social messaging softwares available for both iOS and Android operating system are closed source so even if third party developers want to unify them it's may be not possible in core but if the social messaging platforms are open source then as the code is publicly available online due to that third party very likely can unify them in software level accessing and using all the options and features extensively.

  

In closed source social messaging softwares code is encrypted so if developer of it hide any suspicious code like data trackers or virus you will never know unless you can decrypt them which is way different in open source social messaging platforms where code is public so you can check and verify it's safety then only you can use them which provides transparency with security and privacy.

  

The main advantage and benefit of open source social messaging softwares is as the source code is public for instance on contributive developement platforms like GitHub due to that anyone can via web can commit their own code to improve them including that anyone can use it to make their own custom social messenger of same with additional modifications and changes etc that not just provide plethora of official and unofficial clients but also definetely development of much faster then closed source ones for sure.

  

Recently, we got to know about an fabulous cross platform open source Android unified social messaging software named Beeper based on open source protocol of Matrix which is another social messaging softwares, Beeper despite unifying 15+ popular social messaging softwares also provide iMessage on Android isn't that super cool?

  

But, Beeper though open source and based on open source protocol Matrix it is not free you have to pay monthly subscription fee of 10$ which is bit expensive in developing countries but if you're from developed countries like america then it's quite cheap for that price you get powerful and advanced modern options and features without no ads, siphoning, selling personal data etc.

  

Thankfully, you're someone who don't want to pay for subscription of Beeper then as it's open source you can self host instance using matrix-docker-ansible-deploy which is wise choice as right now Beeper is still in invite only phase which is slow we registered for Beeper a half year back till now they didn't sent us invite link though they may have any reasons but at the end it's quite dissapointing and it's the current at present reality of Beeper.

  

Note : Beeper, is still in early access phase which means development is in progress so you may find bugs or limited number of features but eventually Beeper may fix all issues and release more interesting and exciting features in future, so do we got your attention? are you interested in Beeper? if yes let's explore more.
