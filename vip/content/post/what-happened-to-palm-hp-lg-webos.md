We people begin widely using electronic computers and smartphones including its related gadgets like tablets and smart TVs or watches etc since long time which are now necessary without them in this digital modern world many services will not work which is why alot of companies purely for personal or commercial reasons keep on upgrading them with modern technologies which are quite interesting and amazing.

  

Modern computers and smartphones usually powered by advanced operating systems basically softwares developed using several programming languages which work in-connection with powerful hardware in back end to show or execute any possible electronic and digital tasks that's why it is important to have proper hardware and software on any computer and smarphone etc to be in relax mode. 

  

There are numerous types of operating systems now available on computers and smarphones out if them CLI aka command line interface and GUI aka graphical user are well used around the world mainly GUI ones to name few dominant top operating systems Microsoft Windows for PCs aka Android for smartphones etc but CLI like Linux also has presence globally which is mainly used by almost all developers and hackers who have knowledge on it.

  

Majority of people now a days using smartphones over PCs as they are handheld device and user friendly in inclusion with search engine giant Google free and open source dominant operating system Android which covers more then 70% world wide market share after that in 2nd position comes Apple inc iOS which is closed source so you'll get better security but for customization Android is on go choice according to geeks worldwide.

  

Android and iOS from past one decade stayed on top of charts and remained as most popular mobile operating system availabile for smarphones which now most people like and prefer to use daily but some people want alternatives and try out different mobile operating systems for them Linux and WebOS may work as they run on all PCs and smartphones etc.

  

Linux is actually back then build for computers but later on Linux and it's distributions like Ubuntu and Debian etc  was modified and optimized to make mobile operating system for smartphones right now KDE mobile plasma considered as best user interface on top of Linux distribution available for smarphones but there are numerous alternatives as well like Ubuntu Touch, Postmarket OS etc.

  

If you neither like and prefer Windows or Linux and wanted different software architecture then it will be WebOS which is way different from the regular operating systems that we use now but it has limited persence on smartphones less then 2% of Linux yet it has potential and capability to attract and impress you for sure.

  

When someone say WebOS? you may probably mind of Firefox OS isn't? as it's created by Mozilla being the developer of world's most popular Firefox browser that you may be using now or because of it's huge buzz from paste decade but there are numerous well known reliable WebOS alternatives to FirefoxOS out of them Palm WebOS is one a graphical user interface operating system that was later on buyed by HP after that by LG company from then it was renamed to LG WebOS.

  

WebOS is usually written in HTML5, CSS and Javascript it's operating system is basically like browsers and softwares or applications in context of smartphones are like websites more like web apps due to that WebOS and it's all softwares take minimal resources and can run even on very old less powerful and advanced PCs and smartphones fabulous isn't?

  

But, there are many pros and cons to make few in WebOS foremost it's apps don't feel like regular apps that we use on operating systems like Windows and any Linux or Android and iOS but they are quite less in size and light so they won't occupy much space on your device and open and run apps quickly as much as possible.

  

Anyhow, In case of Palm WebOS intitally developed by Palm inc at first in year 2009 available on Palm Pre and then in year 2010 on Pre Plus and Pre 2 after that in year 2011 it was acquired by HP aka Hewlett-Packard who manufactured and released HP veer 4G, HP Pre 3, HP Touch Pad then later on it was buyed by LG aka Lucky and Goldstar in year 2013 to add on thier smartphones, smart TVs, Projectors, refrigerators, watches and many more.

  

Palm WebOS is closed source and it's later version HP decided to publish it's code as free and open souce since then it is known as Open WebOS after that it got into grip or LG which all are quite efficient and creative for instance Palm WebOS has multi-touch gestures for multi-tasking known as cards that we now use on new modern smartphones but still at the end it received fate of Samsung Tizen OS.

  

Majority of mobile companies like always due to enormous demand they are using Android on smarphones and they didnt want to risk by using other operating systems which can run them out of business like Nokia and Microsoft who used Windows and failed that's why WebOS is not available on smartphones but thanks to companies like Samsung and LG it was largely available on other electronic devices mainly on Smart TVs.

  

LG Open WebOS in it's core is Linux based operating system like Android but it can run only web apps available on it's LG content store which are limited but you can sideload most Android TV apps from 

USB drive or Amazon Firestick, LG Smart Share, Google Chromecast etc including that as it's foss aka free and open source contributive code development is possible to progress it further where you can root using exploit software like Root MYTV to unlock restrictions and get more out of it.

  

In sense, you can't directly run Android apps on LG Open WebOS which is big drawback of it as Android has millions of fantastic apps in it's marketplace named Google Play which alot of people use every day but if customers demand LG to give option to install Android .apk format apps then they may add support for it in future until then you have no option other then to use default web apps of LG Open WebOS.

  

Fortunately, LG redesigned user interface and improved Open WebOS further to adapt it to many other electronic devices including that LG didn't removed old feature Card UI called as simple switching to continue vibes and legacy of Palm inc and HP Open WebOS so do you like it? are you interested? If yes let's explore more.
