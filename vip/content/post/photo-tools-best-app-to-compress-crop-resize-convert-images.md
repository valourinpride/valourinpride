You can capture photos or design images in which ever format or resolution you like,  however the size of image depends on two factors which are resolution and format, if you have higher resolution image then size of the images will be big else it will be low, majority of people capture photos in good resolution to get best possible details, but due to storage issues & social messaging apps and specific websites size limits alot of people want to compress, resize, crop & resize thier existing images.

  

We have many apps and online websites to compress or convert images, but most of them require internet connection, even

don't provide you extra image tools, many apps and online image tool websites don't show good user interface, so people who ever facing issues or insisting for a better one or alternative probably searching for better platform to access image tools.
