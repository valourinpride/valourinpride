Photographs inshort photos are created by camera a revolutionary hardware device technology which can capture real world physical objects on paper or negative reels in black & white and colour mode but the problem here is as cameras capture photo on physical material they can be damaged including that it takes long time to process them in labs so alot of people wanted way better cameras to capture photos at that time we got to see digital cameras.

  

Digital camera is basically electronic device first created by Steve Sasson in year 1975 with latest modern technologies like hardware storage with memory etc and digital softwares developed using number of programming languages like C, and C++ etc which all in connection work  to capture photos in digital formats and once processed they'll become digital files which can be viewed on display screen of supported electronic devices like PCs.

  

Fortunately, many Inventors and companies for personal or commercial purposes over the years developed their own custom digital cameras and updated as well as upgraded them by adapting to latest technologies due to that now we have modern digital cameras like DSLRs which can capture high quality resolution images instantly and efficiently on go.

  

Thankfully, digital camera are also been Integrated on various electronic devices to increase their productivity like PCs, smart TVs, smartphones but most people now a days mainly use digital cameras available on handheld smartphones to capture images as they not only come with quite powerful and advanced digital cameras but also hardware and software to capture images in number of digital formats quite conveniently and comfortably for sure.

  

When you capture images or you may say photos using smartphone digital cameras then they get stored in in-built or external hardware as per your configuration on your device but in order to access the captured photos of any digital format you need to have compatible software isn't it? though most smartphone makers provide OEM photo viewer apps but in some cases you may have to install one externally.

  

But, the problem here is some inbuild or external photo viewer apps don't organize captured photos well though they may look and feel amazing if you have such photo viewer app on your smartphone then very likely you may find it hard to find and view capture photos from device storage which can be problematic at times, isn't that bit dissapointing?

  

Eventhough, if you're are patient enough and can find or arrange photos from photo viewer or file manager app on specific folders then it's fine but most people find it difficult to go through all this which is why large percentage of people like to have an smartphones app where they can organize photos, are you one of them?
