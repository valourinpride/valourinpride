Don't run behind PC to unlock bootloader and install twrp recovery on your android smartphone, now you can do all adb stuff using an app named Bugjaegar, how ever in-addition you need an extra smartphone which will work as PC with USG otg cable to connect each other and get started.

  

Bugjaegar is a mobile adb tool where you can enter and executive adb commands to connected android smartphone to unlock bootloader and flash TWRP or any custom recovery, sideload and flash AOSP images, adb backups, pull or push apks or files and many more expert tools used by numerous developers, geeks and hackers.

  

However, before using Bugjaegar first you have to connect your android smartphone to target Andriod smartphone using USB OTG and install Bugjaegar app on the extra Android smartphone where you can enter and executive commands, but prior to this you have to go to settings and tap on build number option 7 times to unlock developer options in that enable oem unlocking and usb debugging options on both android smartphones to work with Bugjaegar.

  

Remember, each android smartphone has it's own bootloader unlocking and TWRP recovery installation procedure for ex : on huawei devices first you have to turn on USB tethering before you enable USB debugging and on MI A2 and MI A2 lite android smartphones you don't have to generate any bootloader unlock code including that you have to install TWRP recovery on A or B partition.

  

But generally most smartphones has similar bootloader unlocking and TWRP recovery installation method except MI A2, MI A2 lite and other dual A and B partition usually most android smartphones has A only partition, so to be in safe zone check your Android device bootloader unlocking and TWRP recovery installation method on XDA portal to perform any steps.
