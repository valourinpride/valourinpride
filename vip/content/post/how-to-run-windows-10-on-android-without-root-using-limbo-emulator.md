Windows, a popular desktop operating system developed by Microsoft founder William Henry Gates III on Nov 20, 1985 who is well known as world richest man from 1995 to 2017 until he was surpassed by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, anyway you may probably know most computers or laptobs available out there on market are pre-loaded with Windows OS right?

  

Since, 1980s Windows GUI aka graphical user interface desktop operating system dominated PC market even though some people prefer Linux while Apple Mac OS does give tough competition to Microsoft Windows OS over the years still Windows is considered as best desktop operating system because you just have to pay few dollors to own licensed Windows that can be booted on any desktop pc or laptop.

  

Windows OS officially only support and available for desktops and now a days majority of desktop users install pirate unlicensed Windows operating system that is illegal and unsafe as some times pirated Windows OS software may contain spyware or undetectable malware or virus that damage your desktop so it is always better and safer to install licensed version of Windows operating system for security and privacy.

  

Anyhow, Windows OS is undoubtedly one of the best desktop operating system to do almost anything with millions of softwares but after the entry of advanced and powerful hand-held smartphones in mobile market most people especially Millennials and Gen-Z started shifting to smartphones as they are compatible and user friendly thanks to mobile operating systems like Android and iOS etc.

  

In 21st century, we have modern and latest smartphones equipped with powerful hardware and advanced mobile operating systems which are capable to do most works of desktops operating systems but some works require desktop hardware and software to run heavy resources cpu and ram insensitive softwares thus people still depended on desktops.

  

However, Windows pre-loaded desktops costs more then regular smartphone and at present most people don't have interest to buy and use desktop operating systems as they are able to do almost anything on smartphones because of regular software updates and upgrades with simultaneous rapid development to not only provide new and futuristic features but also to improve user experience.

  

Eventhough, you can't directly boot desktop Windows operating system on smartphones due to different hardware and software with system limitations yet it is  possible to install desktop.operating system on Android powered smartphones using Limbo emulator by using that you can run fastest Windows 10 VM - virtual machine without lag on Android for free.

  

Few years back, emulation of desktop and mobile operating systems on mobiles is impossible even thought we have video game console Emulators like PPSSSPP, Lemuroid etc but later on we luckily got some Emulators like Limbo to actually create virtual machines of any operating system with different settings in ease.

  

**[\+ How to install Windows softwares on Android using ExaGear Emulator.](https://www.techtracker.in/2022/05/how-to-install-windows-softwares-on.html)**

  

Limbo is currently the best open source Emulator by properly settings it up you can boot almost any operating system but on Limbo Emulator you may face glitches or little lags while running most operating systems especially Windows as Limbo is still in continuous development phase to optimize further and give improved whole new experience in upcoming versions.

  

If you're familiar with software development then you may probably know running deskop operating systems on Android is once near to impossible task as companies like Microsoft or Apple don't develop and release thier desktop operating systems on smartphones because it will impact and drop sells of thier existing desktop products.

  

So, it is evident developement of desktop emulator for Android is very hard task and takes atleast few years for talented and skilled developers to make it stable due to lack of support from companies, that's why most emulators for Android even being open source on GitHub or GitLab stay at early access phase for long time.

  

Anyway, we recently found a ported fastest Windows 10 which is in .qcow2 format file but you can also use other formats like .vhd or legacy Windowa formats like .iso that you can load and run on Limbo Emulator then use VNC viewer to connect and use without lags, so do you like it? are you ready to explore more? If yes let's begin.
