Web 3, a decentralized internet is the future where you no longer use centralised server that was controlled and monitored by company instead you will be able to host your websites, files everything on numerous servers that was created and provided by individuals like you so that you will get better security and privacy.

  

You may probably know decentralized crypto currency and decentralized finance  DeFi which are based on web3 technology but have you heard of decentralised cloud storage? It is step towards decentralized web 3 internet where you can store your files on numerous servers around the world hosted by people.

  

If you're serious about security and privacy of your files then it is always suggested to use decentralised cloud storage platforms over centralized cloud storage platforms that are managed by single or multiple companies who can access your files and sell your data without your permission for advertising or share with law enforcement agencies to co-operate for legal issues.

  

Most centralized cloud storage platforms use single server to host user files so hackers were able to exploit and hijack centralised server to extract data, but hackers will face super difficulty even not possible to hack decentralized cloud storage platforms as user files are encrypted and splited into smaller files and then hosted on several servers by unknown individuals.

  

Fortunately, there are numerous decentralized cloud storage platforms out there on internet but you have to choose the best so that you won't face issues later in future, recently we found an reliable decentralized cloud storage platform founded by Shawn Wilkinson in 2014 named Storj.

  

Storj is an open source decentralised cloud storage platform aka DCS that not only applies AES-256 encryption on uploaded files but also give 150 GB cloud storage for free with additional affordable paid plans and useful features for users and developers with drop in S3 compatibility, so do you like it? are you interested in Storj? If yes let's know little more info before we explore more.
