Google, a well known american search engine giant buyed an operating system named Android from Andy Rubens in year 2005 but they didn't released it publicly for whatever reason but Google in-partnership with HTC corporation a popular taiwanese consumer electronics company made and released world's first Android OS powered smartphone HTC Dream on October 20, 2008 starting in US to compete with Apple inc. iPhone and it's operating system iOS.

  

iPhone has closed source hardware and operating system thus no one else other then Apple inc. can use on smartphones due to that mobile companies faced alot of struggles to make an smartphone like iPhone but eventually they are able to use other hardware parts from numerous companies that worked out but they lack iOS range operating system so it taken few years to setup and enter into smartphone business.

  

There are many top big mobile companies like Nokia, Samsung who can make high quality hardware for mobile but what they lack is modern operating system to install on thier smartphones even though they're able to make thier own operating system like iOS but it takes years which is why they relyed on basic operating systems like Java and SymbianOS etc.

  

Anyhow, when Google smartly released Android OS as FOSS aka free and open source project inshort AOSP anyone can contribute or use to build thier own variant of Android OS with custom skin, features and OEM apps etc for smartphones based on its hardware specifications due to that most mobile companies gradually started shipping Android OS powered smartphones.

  

Android OS smartphones are less expensive then iPhone and it's first ever mobile operating system that has potential and capability to compete with iOS edge to edge in terms of features but most people who want high privacy and security like to choose and use iPhone's iOS as it's closed source operating system you'll find many restrictions, high security standards and protocols to protect your privacy.

  

On iOS, you can't customize and install third party apps until you jailbreak your iPhone aka root even if you do that yet as it's closed source there are no custom roms so you'll get much better security and privacy to protect from hackers while Android OS is open source thus it's very customizable, you can easily install third party apps and custom roms so hackers has high chance to exploit and gain access to surveillance your Android OS smartphone so you may get bit less security and privacy but not always it depends on various factors.

  

Fortunately, Google over the years on each upgrade of Android OS released numerous exciting and useful privacy protection features at the same time simultaneously strengthened Android OS by fixing bugs with security updates that's great but unfortunately they are limited to new Android OS versions.

  

Usually, most mobile companies stop providing Android OS updates and upgrades on smartphones after 1 or 2 years due to that they become outdated and lack many required privacy protection that can be threat to privacy and security of users for instance privacy dots feature is currently only available on Android 13 smartphones.

  

Android 13 with codename Tirumasu is latest version that has many privacy protection features out of them Privacy dots is one with that you'll be notified when any app on your device use camera, mic and location etc by showing dot thus you can uninstall any misbehaving apps and protect your personal data.

  

When hackers exploit your smartphone either powered by Android OS or iOS on any app to surveillance they access camera, mic and location as they're mostly enough to keep track of you isn't? in old Android OS versions you won't know if any app secretly accessing your device camera, mic and location etc but now on Android 13 we have Privacy dots.

  

Even though, on old Android OS smartphones you can install Android 13 custom roms but not every smartphone have it now even if your smartphone has Android 13 custom roms still in order to install it you have to unlock bootloader and flash custom recovery specifically build for your smartphone from trusted portals like XDA that voids warranty.

  

Thankfully, Danijel Markov known as Paget96 founder of BatteryGuru and LSpeed made an app named Privacy Dots with that you can use Android 13 privacy dots feature on Android 7 and above smartphones without custom roms and root access etc that's cool but it is recommended to block your camera when you don't use for full privacy and security so do you like it? are you interested in Privacy Dots? If yes let's explore more.
