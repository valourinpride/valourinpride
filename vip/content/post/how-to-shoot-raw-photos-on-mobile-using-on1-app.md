RAW images are primarily shoot by editors and photographers via supported camera  as RAW photos capture everything that passes through image sensor without compression and additional changes that are usually applied by camera when processing using software like noise reduction, color correction etc so with RAW images you will get orignal capture to check your photography skills or edit and adjust colour, white balance, tone etc to make it even better for various purposes.

  

However, In order to shoot RAW photos you need such camera which is able to capture RAW photos, most people use high end cameras like sony, canon, and nikon etc to shoot high quality crystal clear RAW images but if you don't have camera then don't worry it is possible to capture RAW images on mobile as well using compatible camera apps.

  

Eventhough, most camera apps including system ones on mobile can't capture RAW images due to no support, but fortunately we have numerous camera apps which you can use to shoot RAW photos on smartphone, recently we found a camera app which is able to shoot RAW photos absolutely for free named ON1.

  

ON1 app has numerous features where you not only able to capture and process RAW photos but also import RAW photos from an attached interchangeable lens camera, hard drive or memory card and edit them locally with powerful masking tools and proffesional effects and presets to take your photography or editing to next level, so do you like it? are you interested in ON1? If yes let's know little more info before we explore more.

Atlast, this are just highlighted features of ON1 there may be many hidden features in-build that provides you external benefits to give the ultimate usage experience, also on ON1 you can purchase in-app features which are able to take your photography and editing to next level.  

  

Overall, ON1 comes with dark mode by default and it has clean user interface that ensures user friendly experience, but in any project there is always space for improvement so let's wait and see will ON1 get any major UI changes in future to make it even more better, as of now ON1 is pretty cool and interesting.
