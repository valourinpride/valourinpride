Awesome in detail article, congratulations! Great that you even manage the brand new option to run it as an Magisk Module. I'will definitely recommend it to people not knowing about FDE.AI! I have just a single minor addtion: feravolt even provided a Magisk Module that integrates the Uperf Magisk Module into FDE. You can download it on the FDE Telegram channel, just search for uperf and click the latest post. This option existed a long time, but was not updated for years but got updated recently. Uperf is an Android user-mode performance controller that implements most of the kernel-state upscaling functions and supports more context recognition.
