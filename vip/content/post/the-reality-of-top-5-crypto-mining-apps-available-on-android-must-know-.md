**However**, people finding new techniques to mine as much crypto-currency's they can utilsing alot of technology devices that are available today in this modern digital world as people choosing crypto-mining as their career and making lives on it which rising more people to find new ways to mine alot of crypto-currency in low time. 

  

We would like to notify all users whoever doing cryptomining in computer, it is also possible to do in mobile but you need lot of mobiles to get benefited from it else it will be hard task so if you have alot of unused or used mobiles / smartphones laying around in your homes or you work or own smartphone showroom with alot of demo smartphones available to you that you can use it for your personal crypto- mining then do try! 

  

The reality is it takes years to mine couple of dollors like 3 to 5$ of crypto-currency in mobile as most of the mining apps that we use were utilising cloud mining which will mine crypto by using CPU but many other

cryto-mining apps opting for ASIC ID over CPU mining because of latest technology. 

  

**Note** : the exact point is there are only few apps available to mine and most of them have its own advantages & dis-advantages which you need test yourself and check which one will benefit and work better for you over other cryto-mining apps available for mobile either Android or iOS etc. 

  

If you really want to benefit from crypto- currency's the only way is to do investing couple of dollors ( buy ) make sure buying charges as low as possible else you won't get profits as you only get couple of dollors profit in months In-simple the higher you invest the more profits will get based on market value and its graphs which predict future growth so sometime in future you may lose alot of money or overnight you may become billionare so most importantly choose the right crypto current which are popular like bitcoin if you want profits fast else asp per XDA article Zcash crypo-mining has good conversion rate and it will give better profit in low time.

  

**Eventhough**, after knowing all the info about crypto-currency and the hard process and risk involved in it but you still want to mine crypto-currency with only single mobile device that you have which will take years to mine crypto-currency thare are only worth of few dollors then this are the popular **5** crypto-currency applications available for mobile

**• How to download Phoneum •**

**\- App Info -** [Google Play - ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cloud.earning)

It is very easy to download phoneum in this platforms for free. 

**\-** [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cloud.earning)

  

The best crypto-mining app available for Android which is completely made for people who want to mine on mobiles, phoneum is very easy to setup which will make you immediately start the process of earning crypto-currency virtually. 

  

** \* The Reality of Phoneum \***

  

Phoneum uses **PHT** coins with today's rate which have minimum payout of 30.000pht

for a normal single mobile device it takes 

around 1year to mine 30.000 PHT when we compare 30.000 PHT to INR it will be Appro 230 to 250rs - 3 to 3.5$  which will at least take 1year if you are active but the question is do you think it's worth to mine 1year for 230 to 250 ruppess with cloud mining technology it's upto you. 

  

The only benefit that we can get from phoneum is it can work in background flawlessly and always connected to cloud mining so it will do rest of the job in back- ground and some other benefits that are available in phoneum were it has VIP purchase which provides faster mining and also gives 4 sessions possibility so you can add upto 4 sessions in one account so it's gives 4x faster reach to 30.000pht and VIP cost you 3 to 3.5$

  

It does also have crypto treasures app which says it will reward crypto's as per **CEO** : **ilyak keylov** In our conversation that it gives possibility of reaching 30k pht more easily If you have any questions or queries regarding the phoneum you can Mail : [support@phoneum.com](Mailto:support@phoneum.com)

  

**Overall,** phoneum also have wallet they highly recommend you to transfer to their own wallet over their as their wallet is supported with very own technology wallet, but in our opinion considering all the factors of phoneum it is not worth to get profits unless you have many mobiles. 

  

**• 2. Reflex Cloud Mining •**

\- **App Info** - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reflextoken.cloudmining) - 

**• How to Download RFX Coins • **

**\-** [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reflextoken.cloudmining)  

  

The currency that we encountered today was RFX coins that was available in install it via playstore with the size of 3.5 mb and it is currently in beta ( Development ) created by **Andrew cisco.**

  

RFX coin is social media exchange currency coin that pay you for views and followers.

  

**• The Reality of Reflex Mining App** • 

  

**Note** : Reflex App is Still in Beta • 

  

\- But let's calculate it was taking approx 50minutes to mine 1rfx coin  

  

\- The app only gives one hour daily mining time which only provide 1RFX coin in 1hr to 50min.

  

\- they also giving daily draw of 10rfx token 10rfx + 1rfx = 11rfx so that in this case it will take around 454 days.

  

\- if I add extend feature available in RFX coins app then it gives me 8hr for cloud mining and also with background mining feature which you need to add additional

cost me 7 rfx coins

  

\- 8hr = 8rfx coin I spend 7 rfx for the extend feature so I get 1 or 2 rfx benefit which is useless I think the only benefit I get was background cloud mining.

  

\- let's see 10rfx for daily draw and 8 rfx for mining with extend feature 10 rfx + 8 rfx = 18 rfx | 5000rfx ÷ 18 = 244 days.

  

• You see they give boost feature which gives 5hr boost with no background in mining so you have keep app without closing 5hr = 5 rfx which is what you pay what you get...

  

\- This is also useless with waste of time 5hrs.

  

So the both features the app gives are useless even after using features you will get to **•1** point there is no use of spending RFX coins on this feature.

  

In this case it will take around 454 days if you mine 11rfx coins daily with no boost and no extend feature.

  

As per ceo : 5000rfx = 0.05$ so let's see 5000rfx÷0.05$ = 250rs which is 3.5$ for 454 days of daily 1hr putting your phone awake with app with no guarantee of mining that as well.

  

**So**.. I don't think it's profitable but it's only good if you have **30** devices or more. 

  

**Now**, you know the reality and features available in reflex mining app as you can see that both the phoneum and reflex mining app have same pros and con's. 

  

if we compare phoneum with rfx mining then the feature of phoeneum which doesn't require to open the app to mine it will mine continuosly for 365 days but in rfx mining app you need to open and keep the app active daily and earn also the app send the money in ERC 20 tokens to ERC 20 token supported wallets only and that to it takes 24hrs to 72hrs to process payment but here the thing is phoneum takes 365days having VIP feature and crypto treasures app but a little lower usd conversation to rfx coin but rfx coin app is still in beta..

  

**So, **understanding the pros and cons of the both the phoneum and rfx coin it can be said **draw** both of them have no bigger + points.

  

**Overall,** RFX Coins is good crypto mining concept with it's very own technology but it doesn't have profit but only knowledge who ever want to gain about cryto coins in our opinion considering all the factors of RFX coins it is not worth to get profits unless you have many mobiles.

  

**3.** **Bitcoin Maker**

**• Bitcoin Maker Official Support •**

\- **No**, support available! 

**• How to download Bitcoin Maker •**

**\- No,** Sources available app has closed all of its operations now along time back. 

  

The third app that comes into the list is Bitcoin maker that gives btc every 5min and you just have to solve little maths like 5+7 = - × within the timer get done. Simple Right ?

  

**Well**, in one answer it's ' **NO** ' unless you may get around 50rs if you put heart and heavy time into it and worry about payement's oof... It's time taking with account issues etc.

  

**Overall**, the app is definitely worth when compared to phoneum or RFX coins in our opinion considering all the factors but the app developers closed it's all operations making the app not available in playstore or anywhere else. 

  

**4**. **Electroneum** 

  

• **Electroneum Official Support •**

**\- App Info -** [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.electroneum.mobile) **-**

  

• **How to Download Electroneum •**

**\-** [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.electroneum.mobile)

  

The is one of the mining apps that we didn't tried but only seen the app have seperate crypto coin which rewards you ETC coins you can either exchange or trade as per your wish.

  

**Overall**, As we didn't the app we can't say either it's worth or not but it's a different crypto coin apps which rewards you ETC do check that out if you are interested. 

  

**5\.** [Hashmining.io](https://www.Hashmining.io) 

  

This is another cryptomining app that we didn't tried, hashmining.io is founded at the end of 2016, the app states it is faster

and safer cryptocurrency in that you have btc, ethereum and many other coins available which you can do payements from app itself that app will never use cpu or gpu or any phone hardware.

  

**Overall**, usually, most cryptominers using websites but we have numerous crypto- mining websites while some are paid or free. if you are interested in mining crypto currency in dual platform like app or web-site then do checkout [hashmining.io](http://hashmining.io)

  

**Moreover**, instead of mining crypto yocurrency on mobile try to install earning apps like taskbucks tha gives more money if you have don't have knowledge on cryptocurrency and it's market then buy cryptocurrency carefully with knowledge as always think before you invest in crypto

currency, because it can make you rich over-night or drag you down to poor with huge losses anytime.
