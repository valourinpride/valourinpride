Do you love music? If yes then you may probably familiar with podcasts isn't? All online music streaming platforms now a days including podcasts due to immense popular among music listeners, however most online music streaming platforms generally only has copyrighted podcasts and music which means you can't use them on your projects.

  

Online music streaming platforms like Spotify, JioSaavn, Wynk, Ganna etc buy music from music producing companies like T series to stream music through thier app and website etc which means majority of online music platforms only has license to stream music so you can't use them on your music and video project unless you have written permission.

  

However, we do have free licenced music and podcasts which is known as creative commons 2.0 so that anyone can use on thier projects absolutely for free without any permission from creators, you may have seen most YouTube creators use create commons 2.0 licensed music on thier videos.

  

Even though, creative commons 2.0 music and podcasts are not upto the mark of copyrighted music because of being free yet you can find some cool and amazing CC2.0 aka creative commons 2.0 licensed music out there on internet if you have the patience to crawl web smartly but it is for sure bit hard to find CC 2.0 licensed music as now a days majority of music creators want to copyright music and podcasts for commercial purposes.

  

Recently, we found a decentralized and federated audio platform named Funkwhale where people can create or join public pods to enjoy and share free licensed music like creative commons so keep that in mind, but you can also share copyright music on your pod but make sure you put them in private to ensure you don't fall foul of copyright laws.

  

Funkwhale is an open source audio platform that has largest collection of free licensed music where some pods allows you to listen music anonymously while some pods wants you to sign up on thier podcasts to listen exclusive content, you can also create and start your own pod to share music via this [installation](https://docs.funkwhale.audio/installation/) procedure but it requires some system skills.  

  

Funkwhale is decentralized and federated audio platform which means the pods created by people are hosted by themselves so that they will have better control over thier content with security and privacy at thier hands, while majority of online music streaming platforms use centralised servers.

  

The problem with centralised server is it has only 1 server which was managed by one or multiple companies who has access to your personal data that they can misuse or sell to advertising agencies for money with or without your permission including that centralised servers are primarily targeted by hackers to exploit and access userdata to sell them on darkweb or publish them online which can cause privacy issues.
