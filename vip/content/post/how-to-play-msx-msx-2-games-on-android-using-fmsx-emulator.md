When computers are evolving back in 1960s to make it capable of executing variety of purposes electronically thanks to Inventors and companies at that time Steve Russell in year 1962 developed and released world's first true digital video game on computer named SpaceWar which is  basically software created using number of programming languages after that we got numerous better moving graphics computer digital video games.

  

Even though, there are many moving graphics digital video games available on computer but alot of people unaware of it as most of them don't even know about computers even if they do as computers are big and expensive only few people could afford them thus reach is limited which is why majority of people back then unable to play digital video games due to lack of huge home space and financial conditions to buy computers.

  

But, the interest to play computer digital video games exists from people around the world due to such high demand many inventors and companies for personal or commercial reasons competed with each other in this capitalist world to make an invention that will allow you to play digital video games without any computer at that time in year 1972 inventors Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney under Syzygy Engineering created Computer Space.

  

Computer Space is world's first digital video game arcade machine which is big and expensive designed for offline stores like shopping centres and gaming centres etc with pay and use system where people just have to drop few bucks to get certain amount of digital computer video games play time that's cool and affordable isn't? but Computer Space failed commercially.

  

However, the template and design with technologies are utilised by number of companies to make thier own version of arcade video game machine with different hardware and software in that process we got numerous amazing arcade video game machines which eventually got super wide popularity with attention and recognition mainly from teens and kids globally.

  

Arcade video games machines are undoubtedly better then computers to play video games as they are totally gaming centric without any distractions but it has few drawbacks same as computers they are big and expensive thus not everyone can afford them and they are not home compatible as well unless you have huge free space and maintenance expenses.

  

Fortunately, In year 1972 right after Computer Space, Magnavox company developed and released home video game console named Odyssey which you can simply connect to Television to start playing set of video games offered by system after that many companies over the years for commercial reasons and to stay up to date in market created thier own version of home video game consoles.

  

The main drawbacks of arcade video game machines whenever you want to play digital video games you have to visit wherever it's available which is not always possible including that they are not one time purchase you have to drop bucks every time to use which is why majority of arcade video game machine users shifted to home video game consoles. 

  

Now, we have modern video game consoles with powerful hardware and advanced software integrated with super fast CPU and GPU in addition big storage and memory they're are designed to save and run huge size heavy graphic resources intensive video games smoothly including that they provide immersive gaming using mixed reality technology which is why they are widely used around the world but few people still want to play old home console video games out of curiosity or mainly because of nostalgia reasons.

  

Unfortunately, most companies stopped making old home video game consoles as they are now focused in modern home video game consoles bussines yet you can buy some old home video game consoles on few offline and online stores but the availability is not guaranteed including that as old home video game consoles are rare you may find them super expensive.

  

In case, you're an collector trying to preserve lost technologies and items for personal collection or museum etc then buying old home video game consoles are worthy else it's better to stay way as we are in 21st century of PCs aka personal computers and smartphones they have potential to play almost all home console video games using emulator softwares.

  

PCs and smartphones can't directly run home console video games due to many hardware and software differences which is why most developers make emulators in supported digital format using numerous compatible programming languages then  implement and emulate home video game console hardware in it's software which is super hard and takes long time.

  

In sense, emulator softwares provide an inside virtual digital environment of home video game console hardware where you can easily side load and play video games like operating system, nutshell and to be exact VirtualBox but most home console video game emulators that we have now and widely used are unofficial ones.

  

Unofficial emulators are developed by third party developers thus they usually not associated with official home video game console makers to get any help and support due to they have to manually create and code almost every thing from scratch then do debugging and testing carefully to find and fix bugs they found or reported by users when using software or while playing digital video games which is why majority of unofficial emulators stay in early access or alpha phase.

  

Thankfully, from past one decade almost all third party developers to speed up development of unofficial emulators putting it's code as free and open source via public repositores on contributive development platforms like GitHub and GitLab etc where anyone through web can register and commit code to software to upgrade or optimize and enhance etc due do that we are now getting faster stable un-official emulator releases.

  

Especially, most unofficial emulators are free and open source thus anyone can also use it build thier own custom version of unofficial emulators with additional upgrades, optimizations, enhancements etc due to that now you'll find numerous cool official and unofficial ports and clients of PCs unofficial emulators for smarphones and vice versa that will further extends productivity.

  

Usually, PCs are more compatible with unofficial video game emulators then smartphones as they have more powerful hardware and advanced software which is capable to play modern home console video games that's why most third party emulators also prefer and like to make unofficial emulators for PCs.

  

Smartphones which came in replacement of keypad mobile phones can do almost all tasks of PC in it's own way but has incapable hardware and software which lack support of many unofficial emulators of PC as it can't run moden home console video games but as companies upgrading smartphones regularly and third party developers also working to port or make unofficial emulators for smarphones due to demand they may get support in future.

  

Anyhow, if you want to play MSX 1 and MSX 2 home console video games they are pretty old and basic due to that third party developers already build many stable unofficial emulators with numerous options and features for smartphones as they are capable enough to play any old classic home console video games well. 

  

Recently, we found an free and open source unofficial emulator from Garage research emulators for Android powered smartphones named fMSX that can play MSX 1 and MSX 2 home console video games so do you like it? are you interested in fMSX? If yes let's explore more.
