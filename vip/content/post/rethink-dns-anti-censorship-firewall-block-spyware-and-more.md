If you jump onto a website on internet you will see url address with domain entension at end which is in alphabet but computers and smartphones don't connect websites based upon its name, in order to connect any website available on internet, browser uses a dns resolver to translate it into a IP address so that it can be connected.

  

Usually, your internet service provider will translate websites into IP addresses, how ever there are many private dns resolvers apps and softwares available out there on Internet with better features, using private dns resolver apps you can get private and fast dns, block ads and trackers, block spy ware and malware, secure dns queries and

bypass internet censorship, including that you can block thousands of websites that are vulnerable with pre-available block list, firewall, monitor internet and many more.

  

However, millions of people un-aware of dns resolver apps and softwares, so they use thier default internet service provider dns resolver which don't protect you from malwares and spywares, don't block ads and trackers etc, which is not acceptable so if you care about security and privacy then it is always better to use best dns resolver app or software which provides maximum features for safer internet.

  

In this scenario, we have a workaround we found the best fast and private open source dns resolver app named Rethink DNS which is part of Mozilla builders MVP program developed by Amazon AWS, IBM, Scientific Games engineers, In Rethink DNS you will get all features to explore internet safely and Rethink servers are available in 200+ locations to speed up your internet, isn't it amazing? if yes get ready to explore more.
