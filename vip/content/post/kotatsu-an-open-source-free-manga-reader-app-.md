Do you read manga on your smartphone? If yes you may probably read alot of them on your manga reader app isn't It amazing to read your favorite mangas?

Yes we know that all of your manga lovers want a fantastic manga reader app which provide you all features to read manga and mutually also provide you extra security & privacy through the usage for cheerful experience.  

  

Most people on internet very concerned about thier online security and privacy these days more then ever before so many companies introduced severe security and privacy protecting terms and conditions to gain trust from users but to get more security and anonymity people started depending on secured & privacy assuring VPNs to protect & safeguard thier personal data but they are not at all enough for Millenials out there, so people starting using open source apps and softwares for more security and privacy.

  

All apps or software installed on your smartphone needs to be secure, we have millions of apps available out there on internet which most of them says and claims to protect user data and provide privacy and security to user but the issue is most apps or softwares are closed source which means normal public can't view it's code so there will be doubts arising about true security and privacy of your personal data.

  

Eventhough, we got very strict laws on protection of users data but still there are crimes everyday can be seen in news on data scandals and private data stoled by hackers etc so there is huge chance your personal data provided to a genuine app that you feels may someday gets into hackers or vulnerable persons, so as safety concerns it is better to take care of your personal data from now itself from every way possible as it is in your own hands to protect and secure your personal data available on your devices.

  

So, foremost as priority the apps that you install and use more often must be choosen carefully because they may prone to hacking so choose any apps either it's a clock or manga reader app from renowned popular company that has best terms & conditions to protect & secure your data and yeah it is always better & best to choose open source apps as you can see the code you can have more assurity that makes you rely upon it.

  

In this scenario, we have a workaround we found an open source manga reader app which provides more privacy & security named Kotatsu which doesn't bloated with ads and unnecessary features so that you will get pure manga reading experience but the only issue is Kotatsu currently only available for Android which is little drawback but Kotatsu may soon available for iOS in future, do we got your attention?
