In this world, scientists developed and released number of inventions over the years which simplified the way we live and work out of them one invention that completely digitalized and connected everyone in the world is internet created by Tim Berners Lee that was actually made for US military operations but in year 1991 it has become open source project.

  

On internet, you can create and publish blogs and websites about anything but in order to access them you need computer or smartphone with compatible browser and proper search engine like Google that will crawl blogs and websites on internet using bots like hummingbird to index and rank them on search engine.

  

Search engines will work 24/7 to rank blogs and articles from top to bottom based on several factors especially SEO - search engine optimization and you can visit any blog or website you like with just url address from anywhere and anytime using computer or smartphone that has  data by mobile or WiFi network operators.

  

In early era of internet, from year 1990 to 2004 we have web 1.0 when people used to create and publish millons of static and blogs to distribute content and then since  year 2004 internet also known as world wide web was upgraded to web 2.0 when people started using CMS aka content management platforms to create modern + advanced websites and blogs.

  

Now, we are progressing towards decentralized internet known as web 3.0 where people no more host thier website or blog on single cloud server provided by one or multiple server instead Web3 sites and blogs data are divided into numerous parts then encrypted and hosted on many servers also known as nodes provided by individuals like you thus your website will never go down and provide you best security and privacy always.

  

However, as each computer and smartphone has unique IP address like web address that is used to identify your device on internet so even when you visit web 3.0 website or blog on internet using computer or smartphone data your mobile and WiFi network operator will know about your activities on Internet that can cause privacy concerns for sure.

  

But, fortunately we have some technologies to escape and hide our internet usage footprint from mobile and WiFi network operators using virtual private network aka VPN, proxy, socks custom domain name server aka DNS etc while VPN is popular and easy to setup thus most people like use VPN.

  

Virtual private network - VPN will connect your device to different region cloud server then encrypt and pass all device Internet traffic through specific protocol thus your network provider no more can spy on your internet activities but as you use cloud server the provider can spy on you even law enforcement agencies can access your search history from them if your VPN provider has privacy policies that comply with law enforcement agencies which is why you have to select VPN carefully.

  

We have alot of VPN providers for desktops and smartphones but most free VPN providers usually only give one or two VPN servers that to with ads which you have to watch every 1hr or day to extend VPN usage timeline that is not isn't? that's why majority of free VPN users eventually switch to paid VPN providers who provide better features and fast VPN servers.

  

I tried several free VPN providers and none of them really impressed except UltraSurf but that has only US server by default with basic features so I explored for another free VPN provider then I found Windscribe that has numerous free fast and quality VPN servers with 2GB data limit per month which you can luckily extend to 10GB by signing up using email address.

  

Windscribe is top notch professional VPN service provider that unlocks geolocation restrictions of any country and has strict no log policy thus no one can spy on you which has all features to become best VPN that also offers pro plan to unlock unlimited data, bandwidth and 63 servers so do you like it? are you interested in Windscribe? If yes let's explore more.
