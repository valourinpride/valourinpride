Voice is the sound form communication that humans known as people in modern society around the world used since ages but later on at one point they found way to express thier voice in written form at first on rocks and metals then after long time to further simply written communication they started writing on papers in package as book due to that people were able to share thier knowledge and information about anything quickly and efficiently.

  

Books are basically blank white or custom color and design papers together which are created out of tree wood pulp or any other compatible material where people can write thier private or public, shared or collected, personal or someone else good or bad any type of memories, information and knowledge etc using liquid substance like ink or print via type writers then they can simply read and keep them as private or they can also sell them world wide.  

  

Usually, majority of people write in books to maintain personal journals and dairies or mainly for educational purposes to note down teachings or other private or public information that they got through personal creativity based on intelligence quotient or research by themselves or anyone else to submit in educational institutions, primarly schools and universities etc including that alot of bussiness owners and employees also use books to write and simply keep track about thier customers personal or financial data and own or clients projects etc due to that books became important and very necessary product globally.

  

But, there are some percentage who beside writing personal dairies and notes in books also want to become writers who based upon thier talent and skills with or without interest and passion etc write and share whatever they know about the topics they selected for instance they may write about personal biography or creative story of themselves or fictional characters etc after that based up on thier potential and financial capability complying with local and international laws or not can market thier books and sell them in one or more accessible countries commercially.

  

Generally, it is super hard for individual or team of writers who don't have personal big amount of money to sell thier books around the world unless they have huge support and enough money received via donations from people or mainly backed up by million or billion dollor company who can hire thousands even more employees to hand write or using machines print alot of copies of one book based on demand then they by keeping aside making costs add few more bucks on finished book then based on their network they'll sell them to book stores who adding some more price sell to customers to make business and get desired profits sufficiently.

  

Even though, since ancient times most people and writers to share information and knowledge on different topics and categories preffered to write and distribute them with books even now with powerful and advanced machines it takes time and lengthy process for anyone but eventually when we got electronic computers the way people read books changed immensely.

  

When we got electronic computers devices evolution of computer hardware Integrated mechanical machines thus instead of mechanically they are able to execute and perform tasks electronically as it's powered by electricity and then they are integrated with digital softwares that are developed using many programming languages which are able to excetute and run tasks digitally, isn't cool and amazing?

  

The entry of electronic computers changed many aspects and simplified tasks in this world at first they are huge and super expensive but thanks to many upgrades and updates with enhancements and optimizations eventually we got home computers also known as PCs - personal computers included with display monitors Integrated with visible format operating system basically digital software in that process we got few softwares which are capable of creating new e-books but also can scan and convert existing books into e-books as well on the go easily.

  

Michael S. Hart in year 1971 by launching project Gutenberg created and digitalized 

U.S. Declaration of Independence on Xerox Sigma V computer which is considered as first digital e-book at first they are basic then later on number of inventors started creating thier own e-books but buying and selling e-books in offline stores raged up in year 1990s thanks to entry of modern electronic computers and it's evolution version PDAs aka personal digital assistants by using them you'll be able to read e-books anytime and anywhere conveniently and comfortably.  

  

Especially, WWW aka world wide web software browser invented by Tim Berners Lee and released in year 1991 allows you to crawl public internet which is standard protocol for computers build by ARPANET designed to communicate and move data on network between computers, back then as internet is public and allowed anyone to create and host softwares in compatible format of websites and blogs etc so few developers and companies developed and released many online shopping and e-book stores which eventually increased growth and popularity of e-books exponentially.

  

Fortunately, Telephone a voice communication device evolved to mobile phones then in 20th century they were evolved to keypad mobile phones and smartphones which despite directly making and recieving telecom network based calls and messages also have operating system to install additional softwares and can do almost all tasks of PC in it's own way with ability to create and view e-books due to that usage of e-book futher escalated drastically. 

  

Anyhow, You may probably already know about e-book reader softwares isn't? If you are here but if you don't know then for you the main speciality of e-books as said earlier they're created using softwares so they are basically digital files in format of .pdf or .epub etc including that you can make thousands even more copies of them in few taps and distribute them wirelessly and digitally wherever it's possible on the internet mainly in online stores due to that without companies and book publisher companies your books for free or minimal costs will reach people around the world extensively. 

  

However, we also have audio books which are digital files and very similar to e-books can be created using softwares but the only main difference here is audio book is Integrated with both text and audio version of e-book explained with vocal sounds by author or anyone else so if you can't see or don't read written languages including that you may even don't want or like and prefer to read e-books by yourself then audio books will work as savior for sure.

  

In order to view either e-book or audio player you must have compatible and supported software on your PC or smartphone and already we have number or existing e-books and audio book players seperately but most of them are not up to mark they are filled with many features and options yet still at the end atleast in our case in one or more sector failed to reach expections and satisy me.

  

Thankfully, I recently in search of best e-book and audio book player apps found Colibrio which is one of the most simple yet amazing feature rich e-book and audio book player that was carefully and smartly designed with new technologies to provide fantastic reading and listening experience through out usage fabulously, so do you like it? are you interested in Colibrio?
