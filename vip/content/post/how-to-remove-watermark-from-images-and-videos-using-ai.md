Images and videos are basically digital formats of photographs and films which are captured using electronic camera in connection with software which you can store then view and see on any compatible electronic device that has display screen monitor like PCs, smartphones, smart TV's etc as images and videos are digital you can not just edit them using softwares like Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Premiere etc but also convert them to number of digital formats like png, jpg, webp etc for various different usage purposes conveniently and comfortably on the go isn't that cool?

  

In sense, images and videos are flexible as they are digital technologies you can store as many images and videos based on device storage capacity including that you can share any size images and videos with fellow people using internet through social messaging platforms like WhatsApp or share them offline between electronic devices using technologies like Bluetooth and WiFi etc isn't that amazing which is why now majority of people capture and create images and videos over paper and negative reel based photographs and films to stay upto date, ain't you one of them?

  

In general, most people capture or create images and videos then keep them private on their personal devices or cloud storage platforms like OneDrive or Google Drive etc so that they can check whenever they want or show it to people but there are large percentage of people who capture and create images to share them publicly with fellow people offline or on world wide web of internet through social messaging platforms or publish them on websites and blogs or social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter etc so that people can see and check whatever thing existed on images and videos.

  

There are many people who regularly capture and create images and videos they are known as creators out of them a lot of creators share whatever images and videos they created on world wide web of internet mainly on royalty free image and video hosting platforms specifically designed for creators like Unsplash where people can check and download them for free or by paying pre-set amount set by creators to use in real world as per terms of service and policies but thing is not every creator use royalty free platforms some creators though like to share and show their images and videos at the end for whatever reasons don't want anyone to use them without permission so to restrict people in using them many creators add watermark on images and videos to get credits and protect their work on the go.

  

Majority of creators just publish their images and videos without watermark as people are more interested in them due to that their images and videos spread faster on Internet but thing is if creator don't add watermark images and videos then people whoever using or seeing them don't know who created them due to that creator don't get attention and recognition from people which works for some creators but there are large of percentage of creators who want credits for their images and videos which is why they add their watermark on images and videos out of them number of creators want to make money out of their images and videos which is why they add watermark and only give watermark free ones to people when they complete tasks or pay money for them offline or online.

  

Usually, if you are someone who want to get credits and get paid for images and videos then most probably you already added watermark on them isn't it? but thing is sometimes there is probability that you may mistakenly added watermark on certain images or videos isn't it? if you do then you may very much wanted to remove them right? or it's possible that you may be a normal person who want to remove watermark of someone else images or videos without watermark as you may be asked for your help or hired by anyone to do this job or you may want to simply remove watermark of images and videos so that you use them somewhere though it's illegal and unethical to use someone else watermark images and videos as they are likely copyrighted but if you do have illicit written permission of creator or you just wanna learn and gain knowledge then you may definitely can remove watermark of certain images and videos for sure.

  

Now a days, we have many softwares available for electronic devices like PCs and smartphones to remove watermark on images and videos but thing is on many softwares you have to edit images or videos to remove watermarks manually which is not easy and in process you may alter existing structure of orginal images and videos unless you're an expert which is not good that's why many developers to fix this over the years created number of automatic image and video watermark remover apps which are way better than  doing that stuff manually yet still at the end even automatic watermark remover softwares are not accurate so to improve accuracy from last one decade almost all developers around the world using AI aka 

artificial intelligence which uses machine learning to remove watermark of images and videos at best level quite efficiently.
