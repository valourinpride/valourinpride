When internet is upgraded to Web 2.0 in that process we got many modern digital platforms and technologies with them you can get and do alot of things due to that some percentage of people for personal or work purposes always wanted such social messaging platforms which has potential and space to adapt or integrate third party technology projects from developers and companies additionally to customize and bring new features timely.

  

There are many social messaging platforms out there on world wide web of internet to make calls or messages using smartphones and personal computers etc but most of them lack many features and has limitations like you can't delete chat messages, channels and groups can only have upto 500 members max, you can't send more then 100MB size digital files etc.

  

Thankfully, in year 2013 founders of Russia's popular social network VKontake released an privacy and security focused modern social messaging platform named Telegram that unlock limitations of regular social messaging platforms with futuristic advanced and powerful features by using them you can anonymously communicate with people easily and comfortably.

  

On Telegram, you can anytime and anywhere can delete chat history in both ends of personal chats, create secret chats with self destruct timer where no one take screenshot or record videos and auto deletes chat history to leave no traces on Telegram servers for extended privacy and security, create numerous channels to broadcast content and groups to chat with upto 200,000 members which is mostly enough to manage large communities isn't amazing?

  

Especially, you can send 2GB size files to anyone on free plan of Telegram if that's not enough then you can buy premium plans to get double features and exclusive features with that you can send 4GB size files including that there are many official bots and thousands of unofficial bots of almost all categories which provide extra features and simplify hard tasks that's why most people are now shifting to Telegram.

  

Telegram provides an Public API which third party developers or companies can widely use to build and integrate third party projects and it's technologies into Telegram and unofficial bots to customize or provide extra features that are officially not available on Telegram.

  

Unofficial bots are one of the main reason why many people use Telegram on daily basis even you can create your own custom Telegram bot but in case you want to create custom heavy resources Telegram bot then you have to know coding or hire third party developers from platforms like Fiverr. In addition you have buy cloud servers which are quite expensive.

  

Fortunately, now a days we have many free cloud servers including that there are alot of Telegram bot GitHub public repositories of almost all categories created and contributed by third party developers around the world by using them without coding you can make Telegram bots.

  

Foremost in order to make your own custom or clone Telegram bot with or without coding you have to get basic pre-requisites like Telegram API ID, API Hash and Telethon or Pyrogram session string based on the type of Telegram bot which you can generate in numerous ways.

  

Telethon and Pyrogram session string is different to each individual account on Telegram which you have to generate using your Telegram API ID and API Hash through cloud server that require terminal knowledge but luckily some developers made session string generator bots which you can use convieniently on Telegram.

  

Recently, we found an GitHub repository to automatically deploy session string generator Telegram bot on Heroku as session string generator is small bot it don't have heavy resources so Heroku free plan cloud server is enough which provide 550+ hours dynos to handle user requests of session string generator on Telegram.

  

But, if you want to make public session string generator bot on Telegram for commercial reasons like to show off your other projects or build big communities even provide paid plans to Telegram users, and make business then it's better to rely and use paid cloud servers from Google Cloud or Amazon Azure etc.

  

Note : now we are going to make Session string generator Telegram bot but remmember the GitHub repository which we are using is banned by Heroku yet don't worry there is simply way to fix it all you have to do is fork that GitHub repository, so do you like it? are you ready to make your own session string generator Telegram bot? If yes let's explore more.
