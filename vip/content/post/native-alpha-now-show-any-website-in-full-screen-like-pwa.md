When you want to visit a website on Internet you have to enter url address in search bar of browser then it will load website using your network data either on desktop and mobile but the problem here is if you want to visit a website frequently then you have to re-enter that website url address every time in search bar to access it which takes bit extra time.

  

Now a days most browsers have option to add any website as shortcut in home screen of your computer or mobile they are known as web app thus you can easily access them from home screen just like real app but the drawback of web app is it don't look or feel like real app as on web app you can't explore website in full screen even it won't show any custom no network error when you disconnect data.

  

However, early browsers didn't even have web app option they are very basic later on talented developers around the world started adding numerous cool and useful features thus we got modern browsers but for whatever reason almost all developers didn't focus on developing web app except Google in year 2015 they upgraded web app into PWA - progressive web app.

  

PWA aka Progressive web app feels like real app but support is not provided by browser instead owner of website himself have to add support for PWA through coding or CMS aka content management systems like Blogger and WordPress etc then only browser will detect PWA on website and enable option for vistors in settings to install PWA and add home screen shortcuts.

**[\+ How to create progressive web app ( PWA ) for blogger easily.](https://www.techtracker.in/2022/04/how-to-create-progressive-web-app-pwa.html)**

  

It is not easy to create progressive web app for website as you must know coding or your content management system have to provide option or feature to enable PWA that's why most website owners don't have PWA support on thier website due to that people still have to depend on basic web app over upgraded progressive web app.

  

Even though, now a days most popular websites adding PWA support but still there are many famous websites which don't have PWA especially new ones who just started thier blogging career and it's not possible to get full fledged PWA until website owner himself provide support for it so if you're used to PWA then you may feel bit disappointed but don't worry there is a way to make website like PWA.

  

Recently, we discovered a app named Native Alpha that can show any website in a borderless full screen window using Android System WebView included with many extra features even though it is not real PWA app yet you will feel like PWA that's the speciality of Native Alpha by using it you can also create home screen  shortcuts with custom icons.
