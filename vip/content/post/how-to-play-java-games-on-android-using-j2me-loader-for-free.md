A long time back, we used to play alot of java games with keypad phones that we enjoyed thoroughly completing missions and levels. but later google conquered all the mobile market with their open source software called android which company's utilised and released smartphones. 

  

Due to advanced technologies used in smartphones like multi-touch or better rom and ram and even big processor in smartphones which improves gaming & multi-tasking experience with inclusion of good quality bigger display that made to give you marvellous experience. 

  

Especially, the less price of smartphones which made android based smartphones to sell like hotcakes, the price of Android smartphones cheaper because android is open source any company can use it and it's completely free due to that company,s able to provide at lesser price. 

  

Eventhough, google's android conquered most mobile market still there is always market for keypad phones either it is java, symbian or normal one's just because not everyone able to use android due to many reasons like not everyone able to use it's multi-touch technology and some want rough usage with simple experience which is not possible in latest smartphones but things are changing now everyone trying change from keypad phones to android or iOS smartphones which is good fortune considering rising modern era! 

  

But, In android you can't directly play java games even you download java softwares or games with .jar extension in android & you try to install the software it won't work as java is different OS and android is most advanced OS which developed infocus of latest smartphones  

  

However, there are many people who still like to play java games which they used to play in thier childhood in video games and mobile keypad phones while some like to try for enthusiastic or nostalgic reasons. 

  

In this scenario, we have a workaround like in PC we have a android emulator that can do anything that we do on android likewise there is an java emulator available on your android device which can do anything that you can do on java device on android. 

  

Yes, java emulator on android was able to install java ( .jar  ) apps or games which is amazing so that you can enjoy java games on android based smartphone. 

  

Eventhough, you can now play java games or apps with java emulator on android still it is required to pick the best java emulator app so that you are able to play most java games without any problems.

  

We have huge list of java emulators apps in playstore and world wide web so it is important to pick the right one else there is chance that may raise issues later. 

  

We do like to play java games so we find two emulators to emulate java games or apps but the emulator that we presenting you now can't run java apps yet it Is able to play java games while ppsskvp emulator was able to install and run both apps and games but java apps can't be connected to Internet which requires an configuration which is not well known.
