Who is your favourite personality? In general each person have his own traits and personality isn't it? usually majority of individuals like their own personality and also like someone else personality due to various different reasons that change from person to person for example : a person like someone helping nature and another person may like talent from same person at the end a person may like one or more characteristics of someone personality.

  

When a person like some characteristics of a personality then very likely that person like to praise or follow them for some people their own family members or friends even sometimes people near to them like teachers or workers etc are ideal personalities but for majority of people famous people like popular and well known actors, politicians, scientists, doctors, astronauts, singers, musicians, sociologists etc are ideal personalities.

  

If a person characteristics of personality are liked by a lot of people around the world then that person get huge popularity and also become ideal personality which basically means people not like and follow a person because that person is popular instead as people for whatever reasons got attracted to that person personality based on the numbers then that person will be famous locally or internationally.

  

Generally, most people as said earlier like to follow ideologies of well known and popular great personalities as they got attention and recognition from people because of their valuable characteristics due to that very likely almost all famous personalities in certain fields like arts, crafts, science etc usually have numerous great ideologies that are very much liked by a alot of people which is why out of them many people want to note down the ideologies of favourite ideal personalities so that they can check whenever they wish to keep track or read them on the go.

  

Fortunately, we have many great personalities in human history of this world on planet earth who expressed their ideologies in form of writing and showed them to fellow people via mediums like newspapers, books etc which interested people for some personal or commercial reasons collected various different ideas of great personalities then printed them mainly on books, calenders, stickers etc.

  

Now a days, majority of great personalities sharing their ideologies digitally through several mediums like Internet and digital newspapers etc but few decades back most great personalities didn't have them so they instead mostly shared their great ideologies to fellow people or written them on books and papers etc even given audio speeches about them to show their great ideologies to people around the world.

  

However, In newspapers or books and on Internet as well great personalities and people only publish their ideology quotes not everyone so in most cases you have to look for specific great personality quotes but thing majority of people like more then one personality which is why for personal or commercial reasons number of people collected ideology quotes of many great personalities then presented all of them in many books, websites, softwares etc.

  

Eventhough, there are many books but now a days we are in modern era of digital technology so people using websites and softwares get ideology quotes of great personalities though there are numerous cool websites and softwares which have collection of ideology quotes of thousands of great personalities but the thing is you can simply find them and nothing else which is kinda boring right? what if we can make finding quotes of great personalities quite exciting and rewarding it will be not just amazing but also super cool.
