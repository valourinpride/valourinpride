Satoshi Nakamoto, a anonymous person in year 2009 created world's first crypto currency named Bitcoin to replace fiat currency and remove middle mans like banks in order to get better security and transparency at that time it was new so value of Bitcoin is low but later on people around the world understood the potential of Bitcoin and considered as revolutionary due to that with in just few years Bitcoin  become most valuable crypto currency.

  

Vitalik Buterin Gavin, a entrepreneur in inspiration of Bitcoin created his own crypto currency named Ethereum which received huge global recognition due to that it eventually reach #2 spot in popular crypto currency right below Bitcoin even today but Ethereum has scalability issues because of that transaction fees is super high more then other crypto currencies.

But, the advantage of Ethereum is it is open source and decentralized just like Bitcoin which has publc blockchain API in that provided few standards out of them

ERC721 allows anyone to build thier own NFT aka non fungible tokens or platforms with thier own changes to remove or add external features thanks to that developers and companies over the years for various purposes created millions of NFTs tokens and platforms based on Ethereum.

  

Fortunately, In year 2017 Ethereum developers Jaynti Kanani, Sandeep Nailwal, Anurag Arjun and Mihailo Bjelic launched Matic network that was later renamed as Polgon network which has it's own token but protocols are designed to fix Ethereum scalability issues by simply processing it's transactions on seperate ethereum supported blockchain then after post processing return to main Ethereum Blockchain in that way transactions fees is minimal which is why most people now a days using Polygon Network to send Ethereum.

  

Even though, after Bitcoin and Ethereum many developers and companies created thier own crypto networks but Polygon Network has most less fees like in cents 

which is open source and has it's own public blockchain running alongside with Ethereum main blockchain so that you can make your own less transaction fee NFTs based on efficient Polygon Network.

Dogecoin is open source meme coin based on LiteCoin created by Billy Markus and Jackson as joke which has japanese dog Shiba inu as logo due to that or may be for other reasons with in few years Dogecoin got super popularity especially when Elon Musk entrepreneur and founder of Tesla and Space X frequently promoted it on his social media profiles mainly on  Twitter and other media channels stating Dogecoin is far better then Bitcoin due to that alot of people buyed Dogecoin that increased it's price to far new heights.

  

  

**[\+ The future of doge coin : Everything you need to know!](https://www.techtracker.in/2021/12/the-future-of-doge-coin-everything-you.html)**

  

In sense, Dogecoin is based on scrypt algorithm which is more convenient and can confirm transactions in 1 minute but it lacks DeFi and other NFT products that're available on other crypto networks due to that for few years Dogecoin users unable to enjoy but recently founder of Dogecoin developed layer 2 solution for Dogecoin named Dogechain for Dogecoin holders based on Ethereum which supercharges Dogecoin for bringing crypto applications like DApps, DeFi, Games, Metaverse etc.

  

However, Ethereum still has scalability issues so Dogechain relyed on Polygon Network that has largest ecosystem to further reduce transaction fees at the same time increase it's speed and bring crypto dApps as soon as possible, anyway right now developers around the world by using Dogechain gradually building many dApps for Dogecoin to make it usable and adapt latest technologies.

  

We have numerous dApps aka decentralized apps based on Web3.0 concept an upgrade of available on crypto networks for various purposes based on different technologies thanks to crypto enthusiasts and companies who are now consantly working on to grow list of dApps out of them blockchain Metaverse is most exciting and interesting one.

  

Metaverse is concept of virtual world of internet where you will get map of any size on that people can create, buy and own digital platforms on particular area of map that anyone can one can access to check your block contents for information or to buy any products on digital shops which is fabulous isn't? that may be the way we use and access world wide web in future.

  

**[\+ UHIVE - A modern social network better then TikTok with NFT market place.](https://www.techtracker.in/2021/10/uhive-best-tiktok-alternative-to.html)**

  

Thankfully, many developers and companies globally build alot of Metaverse platforms which are mostly not based on blockchains but from past few years as we are rapidly developing alot of useful crypto platforms in that process developers build blockchain Metaverse.

  

In order to use blockchain Metaverse you have to connect with supported crypto wallet then you will get maps of real or fantasy world in that at some particular unoccupied area of your choice can create or build digital platforms like dApps, DeFi related to crypto network which people can acess to check to get information or buy and swap NFTs isn't cool?

  

Most crypto networks has numerous Metaverse dApps except Dogecoin but recently as we have Dogechain that uses Polygon which has largest Metaverse studio so many developers and companies constantly working on to build full-fledged stable Metaverse for Dogecoin quickly.

  

Recently, we found world's first Dogechain Metaverse named Doge Solar which is an virtual super power island project where you can ride dog Shiba inu ride on rocket to explore solar system over there you will find planets on each planet you developers build small dApps like contracts, DeFi, betting, mini games etc for users.

  

Usually, majority of Blockchain Metaverse projects has thier own NFT crypto token but as Doge Solar just launched on August 21 it currently don't have it's own crypto token but Solar Doge is planning to it's launch token #DogeSolar this year in month of September, expect it soon.

  

Note : Doge Solar is still in beta stage which means development is in progress so you may find bugs or limited number of features but eventually Doge Solar may fix all issues and release more interesting and exciting features in future, so do you like it? are interested in Doge Solar ?
