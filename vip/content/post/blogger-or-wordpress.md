2\. WordPress doesn't provide SSL it a major backdrop that you have to relay on third party providers.

  

3\. WordPress server optimization was not top notch you have add cloudflare for better speed.

6\. If you got any problem on something or you are not aware of something done some mistake you could possibly loose more, you have to completely understand WordPress environment and backup most priority.

  

7\. Not a easy usable and understanding and you have to keep on updating things etc. Like plugins fix errors and you get more work on website itself rather than content \[ user - specific \]

  

WordPress is a great competitor for blogger it has reached more users than any platform and it is considered as priority for most of the users for advanced features, its best for resource required websites and techy websites or to use own plugins you can find plugins for most of everthing ot can be used for almost all sites etc.
