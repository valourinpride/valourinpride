In general**, android browsers doesn't have ability to view source code efficiently even the popular ones like google chrome or mozilla firefox yet there is some browsers like **Via** which will get source code in text format but it is hard to copy whenever you try to copy everything of source code the app will start to lag or force close itself.

  

But in pc you can easily view source code not only that you can edit it as well by just tapping ctrl - u together.  

  

**However**, in android you still can't view source or edit directly due to limited resources available in android which make things hard this is why most website debuggers & programmers use pc for all the works.
