There are numerous ways to get information mainly from someone via voice languages or in written languages available on any material isn't it? back in ancient times humans now known as people in modern society used to get and share information mostly using voice languages but eventually they figured out methods to express their voice languages in written form since then most people  started using written languages to receive and share information globally.

  

Fortunately, most people due to written languages were able to express and share alot of information by writing them using ink mainly on thin papers and it's packed bundle known as books made out of tree wood pulp which they used to distribute for free or paid in partnership with offline stores in order to widely spread whatever information they created or know as much as possible with fellow people for personal or commercial reasons and purposes because of that now we have information on almost all topics from different number of authors worldwide, isn't that cool?

  

Thankfully, the wide spread of information available on books impacted and changed world in numerous ways it helped in advancing various different sectors like social and political as well as industrial and technological sectors because most people highly relyed on written information available on books to get knowledge and skills which can be used in various ways mainly for personal benefits either to do good or bad mental and physical activities to society or world and universe etc.

  

Even though, we can write and already have information on other materials like rocks, leafs, cloths, metals etc yet still most people eventually used paper based books as it's thin and light weight thus it's quite easy to write and share information around the world anytime and anywhere conveniently and comfortably isn't it? but in order to get or read books you usually have to pay the money and buy them from book stores or anywhere else right?

  

But, when you want to buy many books then it will be expensive so if your financial condition is not up to mark then you can't afford them even if you can buy them still due to whatever reasons for anyone it's not always possible to go stores to get them including that usually certain stores don't have all books so in order to get the desired required books you may have go number of stores wherever it's available that is hard and takes so much time which is one main reason why some people don't like to read or share information through books, ain't you one of them?

  

Especially, books has number of drawbacks like for Instance in order to write or read and print alot of information you have to make or buy many books and then distribute to books stores around the world which is expensive including that books are thin tearable material and they can get damaged by heat, water, dust etc easily so you to maintain them carefully else information will be completely lost that's why alot of people don't like to use books instead wanted better alternative for such people there are digital e-books.

  

E-books basically means electronic books which is software developing using several programming languages like C and python etc accessible on electronic computers first created by Michael S. Hart in year 1971 who launched project Gutenberg and digitilzed united states declaration of Independence then after that numerous people created thier own e-books even converted paper books into e-books at the same time numerous Inventors developed number of software to create and read e-books conveniently and comfortably.

  

There are many benefits with e-books like as e-books are digital software formats created and accessible on computer and visible on display screen monitor due to that it's flexible which allows you write edit, delete and many more efficiently including that e-books can be created in different digital formats and it stores terra byte even more data on hardware storage of computers like HDDs or SDDs aka hard drive and static drives based on capacity which're less expensive then pile of books and it's data can be transferred between electronic computers electronically.

  

Majority of people back then since 1980s widely started using e-books as they are undoubtedly better then paper books due to the demand for e-books rapidly grown worldwide and many authors and people begin making e-books and started selling them in stores but at the end they are like books you have to buy or distribute via stores and they're only accessible on big computers thus you can't easily use them on go so fix this and provide much better way to read books number of companies as per demand and by adapting to latest technologies made e-book readers.

  

E-book readers are basically small size electronic devices like PDAs aka personal digital assistants or tablets which are specifically designed and developed to only read e-books thus you can't do more stuff on it though it's definitely good and provide clean experience to read e-books yet still it has be loaded with e-book digital files that you buyed or got free every time which is very similar to paper books isn't it that's why large percentage wanted much alternative to e-books where they can get almost all possible information available on books or anywhere else for free without e-books for them there is world wide web.

  

World Wide Web inshort WWW is browser software created by Tim Berners Lee in year 1991 that crawls public contents of Internet a standard protocol developed by ARPANET to move data on network between computers at first it used to just messages between computers but when world wide web released alot of people started creating thier own different digital websites and blogs developed using numerous programming languages on computer and with it's storage and memory to hosted on internet due to that usage of internet expanded extensively.

  

However, In the early era of world wide web websites and blogs are basic they are mostly developed using HTML aka hypertext markup language but eventually alot of people started using numerous other programming languages like CSS, PHP, JavaScript etc then using centralized servers which acts as virtual bridge to host on internet and access on world wide web due to that now we have modern websites and blogs where you can view information more pleasently for sure.

  

Since the beginnings of world wide web alot of people through websites and blogs shared lots of information which are not even available on e-books for free, though many of them monetized by ad networks like Adsense yet still you can see them for free including that a lot of people also started digitilzing books to e-books and uploading on Internet due to that now we have almost all publicly available information on world wide web and it's continously updating by creators and publishers to keep you up to date.

  

Anyhow, even world wide web browser software in year 1990s used to be basic considering now which is absolutely revolutionary and amazing back then as almost all websites were developed using just HTML but as said earlier later on websites and blogs keep on upgrading due to that powerful and advanced browsers are required to handle them so many developers created modern browsers to load any website or blog efficiently.

  

Now we have modern websites and blogs with browsers to access them where you may probably get almost all information published easily but most browsers are designed and developed to view websites and blogs not ebooks so if you're someone who like to read e-books or even read information available on websites and blogs in ebook style then you have to choose such browsers that has features to right on do this job for you, 

  

Recently, we got to know about browser named EinkBro that was exclusively developed for Android based e-book reader electronic device named eink but it's browser is available online with numerous options and features to read information like on ebooks now on almost all smartphones and tablets etc, so do you like it? are you interested in EinkBro? If yes then let's explore more.
