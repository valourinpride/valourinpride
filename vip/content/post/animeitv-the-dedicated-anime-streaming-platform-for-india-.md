Animation in short **anime** do you know anime is more popular than movies in japan they will call anime fans as otaku's the anime that we see in japan made with top notch latest technologies.

  

There is huge fanbase for japanese animes in India like dragon ball series, naruto, one punch man and many more.

  

In India, anime cherished the childhood of many Indian children they grown watching animes like the most popular DBZ and many more in thier own regional languages !

  

The channel once upon a time which used to be the hub of animes cartoon network india started to degrade in terms of telecasting the japanese animes instead they opted for cartoons like oggy - the cockroaches, roll - no 21 and more Indian based shows which is likable but the classic shows are slowly completely forgotten.

  

CN - cartoon network India was the only channel to have regional dubs of popular animes of japan for whatever reason they are not intending to go for a proper telecasting of this japanese anime's again like they done in time of 2000's era.

  

In this time the channel brought by Sony TV made new hopes in mind of anime lovers the channel named animax which provided japanese animes in India the day after it was released in japan through television channel the animax channel served for long time but later animax removed by sony for unknown reasons from television in 2017 instead sony stated it will continue animax in IPTV platform which was available in sony liv app but again in 2019 animax channel was removed from IPTV platform due to some negotiations between sony and animax asia due to that anime lovers are in search to find some alternative to animax in India to watch dedicated anime only tv channel in India legally.
