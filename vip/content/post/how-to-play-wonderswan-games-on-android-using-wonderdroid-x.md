When you hear the word video games you may get numerous home gaming consoles in mind but Nintendo and Sony PSP series are right now popular and best home video game consoles which are surviving in this handheld game consoles market since 80s and 90s but not everyone switched to PSP or Nintendo as alot of people and gamers still like to use old discontinued handheld game consoles for nostalgia reasons.

  

We have numerous old and discontinued handheld video game consoles out there in real world and fortunately you can easily buy them on shopping platforms based on it's quality but I say it's not smart decision to purchase old and discontinued gaming console in 21st century due to advanced mobiles aka smartphones that we have today we can play most handheld video games on smartphones using un-official emulators build by third party developers.

  

Most video game emulators available for smartphones are unofficial as companies which manufacture handheld video game consoles don't make official emulators for smartphones as this risky feat will surely drop sells of thier products that can lead to huge losses, but thanks to developers they're able to make emulator for almost all handheld video game consoles.

  

However, developers who make emulators to play video games on smartphones don't get any official support or help from video gaming consoles companies due to that it will take alot of time for the developers to make hardware and software compatible unofficial emulators for smartphones to play video games without issues.

  

The development of un-official emulators is slow as in order to build stable emulator for smartphones developers have to work hard and go through many things, that's why most un-official video emulators stay at early access or beta phase even being open source project on GitHub or GitLab.

  

Anyhow, right now there are number of amazing unofficial emulators available for Android and iOS powered smartphones like J2ME Loader, Citra 3ds Emulator, PPSSPP, AetherSX2, Skyline, etc but majority of gamers don't know that playing videos games without handheld game console is illegal as the video games known as roms that you download from internet are actually extracted from real handheld game consoles and uploaded on web without permission from handheld video game consoles makers.
