Text, the one that you're reading now which is in digital format of english language that you can write in numerous languages thanks to modern technologies but as you may know we people in society first used speech to communicate basically sound form voice languages and then eventually we found a way to express voice languages in written form since then majority of people started  using number of written languages to not just communicate but also share all types of information to people worldwide.

  

In sense, written languages are revolutionary each country has their own written languages same as voice which back then like few decades back people used to write and express them mainly on books but as time goes we eventually got electronic devices like personal computers inshort PCs and smartphones which are Integrated with software developed using numerous programming languages where you can simply express written languages in digital format known as text using any supported keyboard, isn't that amazing?

  

Generally, there are 2 types of keyboards hardware and software which are widely used by people around the world but the thing is hardware keyboards are mostly used on PCs and when it comes to software keyboards they are mainly available on handheld smartphones and smart TV's etc at the end in order to work well on any keyboard you have to depend on numerous technologies of electronic devices so that you'll be able to input text correctly and efficiently on the go.

  

Eventhough, nowadays majority of people using digital texts to communicate with anyone but not everyone want to use text for various reasons and purposes there are large percentage of people mainly old people due to lack of knowledge on latest modern technologies using ancient voice languages speech to share information and communicate with people worldwide as it's not just simple but also can reach  and able to work quite effectively.

  

In most cases if people use speech then very likely they won't use the text except in latest movies and music in form of lyrics and subtitles etc but even in those alot of them don't have text version of speech as creators sometimes don't add them which is why if you're someone who want to get text version of speech then most likely you have to carefully listen to speech then you can manually transcribe it to text but if it's lengthy speech then you may not just find it hard but doing all this takes long time.

  

Most people when electronic devices like PCs and smartphones are unavailable used to manually transcribe speeches to written text by simply listening to them for newspapers, journals and many more but eventually mainly since digital revolution started in 1980s we got various different revolutionary technologies which are now modern by using them we can transcribe any speech into text automatically.

  

Now a days, we have revolutionary  Artificial Intelligence inshort AI and machine learning technologies which are widely used on robotics that is basically like artificial human brain which can think, learn and execute almost all real life tasks so many people in order to simplify and automatically do various different tasks since long time using the potential and capabily of AI aka artificial intelligence quite comfortably and conveniently.
