There are several mobile operating systems available for smartphones but Android from search engine giant Google  is most popular one with big market share around the world as it's open source most mobile companies pre-installing Android over other operating systems like iOS, FirefoxOS, Symbian, Java etc.

  

However, Apple's iOS is more secure because of closed operating system but iOS is not customizable like Android thus many iOS users switch to Android or like to install Android on Apple's iOS but it is near to impossible as both are based on different software and hardware.

  

Now a days, most people buying big ram and rom Android powered smartphones but some users for whatever reason still use old smartphones that has low storage and memory thus they are unable to play big games and run apps and to fix that problem majority of users buy SD cards or pendrive etc but there is an easy way to fix this using cloud technologies.
