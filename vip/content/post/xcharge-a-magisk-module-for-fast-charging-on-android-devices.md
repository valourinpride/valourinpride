Charger is basically a electronic product 

which we have to plug into switch board and connect to electronic devices like PC, smartphone, smartwatch and power banks etc using micro or type c USB cable that based on it's voltage capacity will get AC aka alternate electric current from pluged in power sources and then it converts AC current to DC and supply to the connected electronic device once electric current get passed into electronic device then based on the hardware and software receiving capacity mainly battery capacity of device which is in mah aka milliampere hour store electric current once it's in sufficient level battery supply power to electronic device whenever required till it can after that we have to power up using charger again.

  

In sense, if you own electronic device then it's quite essential to have charger as you usually have to charge it everyday or atleast once in week or month based on battery capacity of device if it's high then you may not have to charge frequently but if it's less then you have to charge in less time intervals which is something most people don't like that's why a lot of people like and prefer to buy devices with big battery capacity so that they last long time back in time like few years ago we used to have small batteries but eventually as there is high demand for big batteries to supply them many companies around the world started making and integrating huge batteries on electronic devices which are now widely used by people globally.

  

There are many types of batteries out of them silicon and lithium are popular ones at present on most electronic devices we mostly using lithium batteries which are way better than silicon but if they charged a lot over time it's battery capacity will be reduced thought there are few drawbacks with lithium batteries at the end they are many benefits like less expensive with quick charge and big battery capacity so they are definitely better choice then old silicon batteries but thing is as battery capacity increases the time to charge it up will also increase which is not good right? as we people want to use device as soon as possible so to reduce charging time of batteries companies introduced number of fast charging technologies and pretty high voltage super chargers to charge battery quickly and save time of users on go.

  

Eventhough, we have high voltage chargers and fast charging technologies for almost all electronic devices but the one which we are going to discuss now about are smartphones as you may know at present we have pretty high voltage chargers like more than 60 volt and number of amazing fast charging technologies based on the processor like for Qualcomm Snapdragon we have quick charge and for Mediatek we have IC and pump express when it comes to device specific oppo has its own closed source world's class super vooc flash fast charging technology which all charge the device battery rapidly mainly latest ones have potential to charge within 30 minutes but the problem here is fast charging will have negative impact on battery it will not only reduce but also damage battery so to keep device safe makers put hardware or software limits on charging speed due to that it usually take quite long then normal to full charge, bit disappointing isn't it?

  

The slower we can charge the battery the less heat and more lifespan we can get on battery of devices including that as per experts for protection of battery it's always better to not let battery percentage go below 20% and above 80% but thing is for whatever reasons it may be not always possible for you to charge battery at low voltage like in scenario you may have to use device or go somewhere urgently etc right? in that case you may definitely have to fast charge battery using high voltage chargers and fast charge technologies but thing is on almost all smartphones makers apply set of fast charging limits in system they adjust charging speed automatically based on usage and heat etc which you may can't change unless you root device and gain system level access then modify all necessary related system files which is risky and voids device warranty as well.

  

There may be number of reasons why device makers put charging speed limits at the end they do this mainly to protect battery and keep it cool and healthy so that device performs well if for whatever reason you don't like system preset charge speed and want to change then you either have to be skilled developer or techy who have knowledge on structure of operating system and smartphones so that you'll be able to make changes correctly or else if you do any incorrect changes in system that can either hard or soft device which is sometimes irreparable so kindly always be careful when dealing with this but even if you do everything right still there's chance that you may won't find any difference in charging speed that may happen mainly when your power source voltage itself is low to findout use apps like BatteryGuru and then fix or change power source to restore fast charging quite instantly.

  

In case, you don't know how to change system files and don't wanna mess things up for fast charging on smartphones then don't worry there are few simple ways to  bypass system restrictions and enable fast charging as you may know there are many operating systems but the one with 70%+ worldwide marketshare is Android which is foss aka free and open source software released by Google due to that third party developers globally were able to do extensive custom developement in that process they discovered way to root which provide access to system level aka root where you can change system files to make device as you like thought there are many ways to root Android device but for latest version like Android 6 marshmellow and above we have Magisk root in that you can install modules to change things on Android devices easily, isn't that cool?

  

Eventhough, we have few ways on rooted Android smartphones for fast charging but installation of magisk module is safe and effective as in Magisk you have bootloop rescue and you can uninstall root even remove any troubling magisk modules from custom recovery like TWRP to get back on Android but thing is we have very few magisk modules for fast charging out of them we recently got to know about one interesting and simple foss aka free and open module named Xcharge developed by iamlopper which main function is to mutate /sys/class/power\_supply/battery/constant\_charge\_current\_max so that it can change power supply to battery and improve fast charging on specified device including that it also change temperature limit at which charging will be slow down by system at the end you will get 3 modes fast, faster, fastest to to access them you have to execute su -c xcharge command line on Termux app, so do you like it? are you interested? if yes then let's explore more.
