It is possible to transfer huge files through internet using cloud hosting platforms or a cloud messaging app but sending files via internet costs alot of network data for the sender & reciever so it is always better and best to transfer huge files by copying your files to hard drive or usb pendrive, memory card to transfer them to any other devices because it's faster and safer.

  

However, big files transfers through bluetooth takes days and files transfer through hardware, usb pen drive or memory card is old procedure which is still popular method but you need to have this extra products with you else you have to buy them which costs few bucks, but in this smartphone era we got new features and technologies to transfer files without internet using hotspot but due to android software limitations to use wifi hotspot transfer functionality you must need an file transfer app which can transfer huge files to any device in minutes based on its size absolutely for free.

  

We have numerous file transfer apps available out there on internet like most popularly shareit & xender but alot of file transfer apps are closed source & bloated with ADS & uneccessary features which can effect user experience so it is always preferable to choose best, secure and fast file transfer app for good results either for Android or iOS powered smartphones.

  

In this scenario, we have a workaround we found an open source best, free and fast  file transfer app named TrebleShot by Veli Tasali for people who care about thier security and privacy, TrebleShot not bloated with ads and unnecessary features so that you will get pure file transfer experience but the only issue with TrebleShot is currently only for Android which is little drawback but TrebleShot may soon available for iOS in future, do we got your attention? Are you interested on TrebleShot? If yes let's know little more info before we get started.
