Mdisk is rising free unlimited video hosting platform which is right now hub of piracy, anyway Mdisk is best alternative to Pdisk with almost same features, but the only difference between them is Mdisk videos can be streamed and downloaded via MX player, while Pdisk use PlayIT.

  

When Pdisk received numerous complaints from DMCA they have no choce other then to shutdown Pdisk so that atleast domain will be safe, but the users who depended on Pdisk to upload videos and earn money were searching and roaming around on Internet to find best alternative to Pdisk.

  

At the time, after few weeks or months Mdisk appeared on internet with better customer support and features but just like Pdisk, the founders of Mdisk are not known publicly, anyhow people stopped worrying about Pdisk and started using Mdisk to upload videos and earn money.

  

**[\+ Mdisk - best unlimited cloud video hosting alternative to Pdisk.](https://www.techtracker.in/2022/01/mdisk-best-unlimited-cloud-video.html?m=1)**

  

But, as we said earlier to stream and download Mdisk videos you have to use MX player and that app consume alot of data atleast in our test, and not everyone like to use MX player as numerous users depend on best download managers like 1DM to download videos fast, but Mdisk force users to use MX player or S player which is not satisfactory.

  

However, I also don't like MX player to stream or download Mdisk videos and I prefer download manager like 1DM so I found a easy way to stream or download Mdisk videos using download managers and Telegram bot, but the only issue here is you must have MX player on your device so that you can copy Mdisk streaming url on MX player and sent it to Telegram bot or download manager, which is simple process just follow our step by step instructions below, are you ready?

  

Recently, I found a bot to automatically download Mdisk videos without MX player or any download managers using a simple yet amazing Telegram bot named Mdisk link to file downloader bot absolutely.for free, so do you like it? are you interested in Mdisk link to file bot? If yes let's explore more.

  

Note : this method and process given below is completely and totally legal because here the official API provided by the platform itself was ethically used by some third party developers to get desired features and options with unofficial bot so if there is any issue araised regarding this then effected persons kindly may contact owner and host of this bot to resolve any matters, I just shown this bot working process purely for demonstration and information purposes, hope you mind it.

That's it, 1DM will download Mdisk files.

  

Atlast, this is how you can download Mdisk videos using Telegram bot but you can use same link that you copied from MX player to download on download managers like 1DM or stream on other video players like PlayIT, VLC etc, if you like Telegram and use it as cloud storage  then this is best and preffered choice and you can also simply forward videos with fellow telegram users.

  

Overall, all three apps are simple and clean with intutive design and interface which ensures user friendly experience, and it's pretty easy to copy Mdisk streaming link from MX player, but in any project there is always space for improvement so let's wait and see will these apps get any major UI changes in future to make it better as of now I got satisfactory experience.

  

Moreover, it is worth to mention this is the only available method to copy Mdisk video

streaming url using MX player, eventhough Mdisk also support S player but there is no option available to copy streaming link, so as of now you have to rely on MX player as it's the only option available, we even tried to extract Mdisk video using methods like resource snipper but unfortunately it didn't worked may be Mdisk encrypted or hidden video url so it can't be detected on site.

  

Finally, this is how you can download Mdisk videos using Telegram bot or download managers, are you an existing user of this method? If yes do say your experience and mention if there is any other method available to stream or download Mdisk videos without MX player in our comment section below, see ya :)
