Team work not only save time but also increases the efficiency to manage your clients isn't? If you work in customer care or in a company where you have to spend alot of time replying your customers then having a team with you relieves the stress and simplify things right?

  

Now-a-days most companies provide thier own software for employees to collaborate and work together and manage customers, clients easily, however client and customer management softwares or apps developed by companies are not available for outside public and usually they are closed source.

  

So, incase you owns a company and don't have any software then you have to rely on public softwares or apps which are reliable and has required features, recently we're in search of interesting apps and fortunately we found an app named Gmelius which is first collaboration platform that Integrates natively Inside Google Workspace.

  

In sense, Gmelius simply use your Gmail account and provide numerous amazing features like shared inbox, shared Gmail labels, Email assignment, Email tracking, 

Email notes, Email Templates, Send later, Email sequences, customize your swipes, meeting scheduler, snooze, follow ups etc to simplify teamwork.

  

On Gmelius, you can also connect with daily apps like slack, trello and you will get real time sync with your web app thus all  changes you made on Gmelius mobile app will immediately show on Gmelius inbox in your browser and if you set an integration  for example : if a shared inbox is synced with a slack channel then Gmelius app will work together with web app.

  

Note : Gmelius is still in beta access phase which means development is in progress so you may find bugs or limited number of features but eventually Gmelius may fix all issues and release more interesting and exciting features in future, so do we got your attention? are you interested in Gmelius? If yes let's know little more info before we explore more.
