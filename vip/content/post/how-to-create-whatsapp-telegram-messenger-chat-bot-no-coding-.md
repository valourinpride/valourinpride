The era of digital softwares started in mid 19th century when computer a hardware based mechanical machine founded by Charles Babbage was convered into electric machine using his own concepts and new technologies by inventors and companies around the world mainly in America for various purposes after that it gone through alot of advancements due to that in just few decades computer was integrated with two types of operating systems CLI aka command line interface and GUI aka graphial user interface which is basically software environment that can install more external digital softwares.

  

Softwares are developed using various programming languages which can do almost all real life physical actions required tasks electronically and digitally if programmed correctly based on hardware capabilities of computers at first in early era of computers we don't have powerful hardware thus software is very basic but later on as time goes many inventors and companies for personal or commercial reasons build powerful computers which can install and manage heavy resources digital softwares super easily.

  

However, electric computers in beginnings are big and expensive thus it was mostly limited to millionaires and companies in factories and companies even operating system based ones thus reach to common people is minimal but as there is demand in this world of capatilist world with full of  competition existing and new inventors and companies constantly worked on to reduce size and price of computers due to that by 1970s era we got home compatible less expensive electronic computers.

  

Anyhow, since the era of operating system based electric computers there are alot of digital softwares for various purposes of almost all categories which are later on integrated with IP aka internet a standard protocol developed by ARPANET to move data between computers on network that also provide unique IP address to identify and communicate each other at first it is used to send digital text messages after that internet gone through alot of updates and upgrades with that simultaneously the usages also extended immensely.

  

Even though, the capabilities of digital softwares with inclusion of internet definitely worked out especially in contrast to digital communication purposes which replaced traditional communication ways like telegraph and postmans etc but in beginnings messaging is limited to CLI based operating systems thus it's not easy to use unless you're programmer that was later replaced with GUI based messaging softwares by integrating and adapting to latest technologies accordingly to provide more features and options for convenient  instant messaging for everyone.

  

But, instant messaging softwares either it's CLI or GUI used to send only text based messages back in year 1980s when we are gradually getting into PCs at that time Internet is private and require manual access to communicate with each other but after a decade in year 1991 Tim Berners Lee developed and released WWW aka world wide web browser software to access public contents of internet that got recognition and attention globally.

  

World Wide Web is revolutionary software that unlocked limitations of internet as it let you access public contents of internet many people around the world started creating different digital platforms using various programming languages in form of websites and blogs etc on thier HDDs and SDDs of computer then created a server that uses RAM to host publicly on internet in that process we got numerous cool and amazing digital platforms and softwares of almost all categories online.

  

In year 1992, Nathaniel Borenstein and Ned Freed created MIME protocol for internet which will let you send multi-media messages like videos and audios etc through internet that was integrated into internet protocol based instant messaging digital platforms and softwares like Email and ICQ etc and further developed with advancements to update adapting to new technologies due to that we go modern instant messaging digital platforms and softwares.

  

[Sixdegrees.com](http://Sixdegrees.com) is first social media network on internet created by Andrew Weinreich in year 1996 available in form of website that will let you send messages, create and manage profiles, friends list  school affiliations in one service after that alot of developers created thier own social media network and messaging digital websites with new features and options out of them some are developed or we can say converted as digital softwares as well to use on computers without browsers.

  

Anyhow, Modern social messaging platforms either website or software started getting it's shape in early 20th century when it was not only able to send text or multi-media messages but also has technologies to do live stream audio and video calls with individual or communites around the world then after an decade in 21st century thanks to developers we got much more social messaging softwares.

  

Now a days, social messaging softwares are cross platform compatible so it's not only available in computes but also for various electronic devices like mobiles, TVs and smartphones etc which provide alot of awesome features to name few  you to send unlimited text, audio, video messages, create and maintain small or big channels and groups to broadcast content or chat with community, send huge size digital files of any format and create powerful and advanced bots etc conveniently and comfortably.

  

There are 3 popular social messaging social messaging that are widely used by people around the world named Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram while Facebook was actually an social media network started as an online website but later on it's developed software version it with an seperate social messaging platform known as Messages which all have useful and exciting features so they are well used for both personal and business purposes.

  

In the beginning of internet majority of people used social messaging softwares for personal chats but when  modern social messaging softwares came into existence it's developers integrated business related features as per demand of users due to that you can manage your customers and clients etc but you have to reply every one them of individually even for same basic repeated questions that's hard and take time isn't?.

  

Generally, most social messaging platforms that we use now like Facebook, Telegram and Whatsapp provide alot of  features for business users yet don't give any direct auto reply feature for whatever reasons they may be working on that right now but released an API aka application programming interface publicly that you can use to create clients or bots with ability to auto reply messages known as chat bots in current times.

  

If you are someone who don't know coding but still want to create custom heavy resources social messaging chat bot then you can hire bot developers from free lancer platforms like Fiverr that will cost money or else you can try no coding required third party chat bot online development platforms but most of them are quite expensive with limited free trails. 

  

Fortunately, we have several completely free social messaging chat bot developement platforms with certain limitations and restrictions but it will definitely work in case you just want to create an simple auto reply chat bot for number of users in your contacts for personal usage not commercial where you have to deal with millions of customers in  big enterprises and businesses etc.
