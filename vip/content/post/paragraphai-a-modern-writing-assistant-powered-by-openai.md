Well, in this world there are two methods primarly used by humans known as people in modern society to share information which are mainly voice basically sound form languages and then comes written languages which almost all people around the world share through various different mediums like TV aka television channels, newspapers, products, services, articles, books, pamplets and many more.

  

Even though, now a days both sound and written form voice based languages are used to share information extensively because of modern media technologies but back then like more then century back most people used written languages on various materials mainly on newspapers and books to share whatever information with people locally and worldwide.

  

The main advantages here with written languages is you'll be able to express and share information without showing your identity anonymously including that you are able to share a lot of information in your own writing style in local or global international languages then simply share it with people anytime and anywhere quite conveniently and comfortably on the go.

  

In 21st century, we're in digital technology era where though written languages are used on physical materials but large percentage of people already moved to digital technologies and softwares like internet and world wide web to write and share information with people digitally via number of electronic devices like personal computer and smartphones efficiently.

  

In sense, now a days most people not just writing but also sharing it mainly through digital softwares available on PCs and smartphones but in order to store or share any information you have to write them manually which is totally fine to majority of people but some people for whatever reasons don't want to write on their own so they instead hire people to do that job.

  

Especially, it is quite hard and difficult to manually write a lot of information on physical materials or digitally on electronic devices isn't it? That's why some people want to write information automatically which is not possible few decades back but now it's possible with latest modern technologies like artificial intelligence.

  

Artificial intelligence inshort AI is revolutionary technology that using machine learning can auto execute most real life tasks electronically and digitally which is now widely used in many fields mainly focused on robotics but number of developers created AI based softwares to write or correct information automatically based on input of user, isn't that useful?
