Xerox is world's first company in year 1974 developed and released GUI aka graphical user interface operating system for electronic computers which is way better than any other existing operating systems like CLI aka command line interface which is why people around world now a days widely using GUI based operating systems on computers as well as on other devices like smart TVs and smartphones etc.

  

Even though, there are drawbacks in both CLI and GUI based operating systems but at the end GUI one is way more easy to use as over there it will present data available on electronic computers in more appealing way with visual graphical design everywhere which you can access simply using mouse pointer that is different in CLI there you have to use keyboard commands that's not easy one unless you are coder which is why majority of people around the world like and prefer to use GUI over CLI based operating systems for sure.

  

Anyway, CLI or GUI are digital softwares developed using numerous programming languages availabile for hardware based electronic computers and other devices not mechanical machines which can execute tasks electronically and digitally but either it's CLI or GUI you will only able to see visual digital form of them on display screen monitor Integrated on electronic devices so that you can access them comfortably and conveniently.

  

Fortunately, many inventors and companies since mid 19th century as it is when all started continously upgraded CLI and from year 1970s GUI operating systems using and adapting to latest technologies due to that we got powerful and advanced ones but since begginings there is always need of sharing data of computers in visual form with anyone which is why from year 1960s numerous Inventors developed various methods and techniques to capture screen at first they are basic and hard to use as well.

  

Thankfully, In early 20th century we got to see in-built softwares to capture screen known as screenshots for desktop operating systems availabile for home compatible PCs aka personal computers like snipping tool for Windows Vista or later version GUI based operating systems of Microsoft inc. since then onwards alot of people started capturing screenshots of computers for various purposes mainly to share with people using communication technologies like Internet, isn't cool?.

  

Now a days, the inbuild or third party digital screenshot capture softwares are widely and extensively used by large percentage of people globally on numerous electronic devices mainly on handheld smartphones which is evolution of PDA and keypad mobile phones with functionality to make telecom network based calls and messages with data and also Integrated with operating system that can most tasks of PCs efficiently.

  

Smartphones are handheld electronic devices which neither comes with physical mouse pointer or keypad instead it has multi-touch technology so you can use it's operating system with your fingers easily due to that you can use smartphones on the move like while walking or running etc the same feat is hard on PCs mainly with big ones that's why most people who like and prefer easy to use electronic devices simply buy and use smartphones.

  

Anyway, if you are using smartphones then as you may know with in-build system or third party software you can capture screenshots like PCs isn't it? but with different button mostly volume down and power button for all devices that may be different in some smartphones, but  anyway most inbuild screenshot softwares comes with less options and features due to that you'll only able to generate normal screenshots, isn't it bit disappointing?.

  

What if, you can take screenshots with added background design of yours or other smartphones it will be amazing right? usually to do this most people and graphic design artists first using thier camera capture availabile smartphone of thier choice at desired locations mainly in digital .png image format then later on by using editing softwares remove display and background parts to add custom ones that create template which can be used to put external background and screenshots etc to maximize productivity but is kinda lengthy process and not easy.

  

In order to create pleasing templates for smartphones you need skills to capture or design various smartphones with different angles and backgrounds thus whenever you add external images like screenshots on display of smartphones due to amazing background it will look and feel fabulous definitely better then regular inbuild plain screenshots for sure, don't you think?

  

If you don't know or has no interest to create your own smartphone templates but want them for personal or public projects like for instance to showcase your softwares or products etc in best way possible on smartphones then show up on software marketplaces, sociol media platforms, websites and videos etc then you may probably have to hire someone or freelancers from online platforms like Fiverr but it will cost money not free.

  

Recently, we found an app named HiShoot2i for smartphones with numerous options and features where you can add and use number of smartphone templates provided by community which you can customize to add your screenshots or any other images etc to get desired look and feel output in return effectively so do you like it? are you interested in HiShoot2i?
