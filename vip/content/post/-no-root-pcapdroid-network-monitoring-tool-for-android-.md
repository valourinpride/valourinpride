Do you want to monitor, capture or analyse your android device network traffic? then it is very essential to have a network capture & monitoring tool on your android device if you feel any unusual and irregular network activity like if your mobile data running out faster or network usage is alive even when your device in airplane mode then network capture & monitoring tool will be useful to determine any suspicious activity on your android device with detailed information of your network traffic Instantly.

  

Network monitoring & capture tool will be mainly used by developers and companies to test thier apps traffic to find out either it is working properly or not including that network monitoring and capture tool will be essential and helpful to trace low level detectable hacking on any device.

  

For example : if you have any app that is using your mobile data continuously in background on your android device then using network capture and monitoring tool you can easily analyse network traffic of  your android app and find unusual and suspicious activity if exists so that you come up with resolution and fix it, it is always better to uninstall suspicious & malicious app incase if you found such apps to be in safe zone.

  

If you use any video streaming app where the app don't show you video URL or even not provide you download option then you can't stream the video in any video players or download video offline but by utilising network monitoring and capture tool you can capture network traffic of that video streaming even it's live to find the hidden video links of that app in network capture but note you can't apply these method to all apps as some apps strictly encrypted by the developers to protect thier content from unauthorised usage and piracy.

  

We have numerous network monitoring and capture tool apps available for Android out there on internet but most of the network monitoring and capture tool app requires rooting which will voids your android device warranty so if you have new android device or you don't want to root your device then you need to find such network monitoring and capture tool which works perfectly and accurately in no-root android devices.

  

But, we have very few network monitoring and capture tool apps available for no root android devices so you have to find & use the best one else you may issues later, but don't worry we found the best open source network capture and monitoring tool that is developed for all no-root android devices named PCAPdroid which provide security, so do you like it? are you interested in PCAPdroid?
