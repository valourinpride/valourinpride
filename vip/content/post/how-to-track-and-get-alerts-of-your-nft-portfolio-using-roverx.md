Now we are in world where large percentage of people reduced usage of paper money basically fiat currency instead using crypto a decentralized digital currency to send and receive money around the world first created by Satoshi Nakamoto named Bitcoin back in year 2009 after that many developers inspired by it created their own crypto currencies using various different technologies out of them almost all are decentralized and like  Bitcoin they are mainly created to replace untrustworthy middle man's like banks and provide total control ownership with top notch security and transparency on go.

  

Crypto currencies can be stored on hardware and software wallets by using them people can also send and receive different supported crypto currencies from fellow people around the world unlike banks where you usually won't know how they process your deposited money but in most decentralized crypto currencies for Instance Bitcoin when you send money it will process using proof of stake method where number of people using computers known as miners solve block algorithms to validate and verify transaction for that they get small share as reward after that when transaction process completes to receiver it's details will be recorded publicly in the blockchain explorer of crypto currency.

  

Especially, the main advantage of using crypto currencies is in order to store them all you need is basically a crypto wallet which is totally owned by you and usually don't require verification of government documents and they are only accessible using private backup keys generated by crypto wallet without them no one will be able to access funds stored in crypto wallet due to such secure and robust architecture of crypto currencies they are primarily used by alot of people who want anonymity and one of the best alternative to centralized banks, isn't that amazing?

  

Usually, back in time like few years ago crypto currencies same as fiat currency used to work as money and they are considered as assets which have value that depends on buy and sell in crypto market basically like forex market even now crypto currencies are primarly used as money but thing is lately from past few years alot of developments has been done on crypto currency technologies by their founders to make them even better and useful by adapting to latest technologies in that process we got to see Web3 dApps and NFTs aka non fungible tokens which are basically unique digital assets created using crypto network technologies.

  

NFTs are basically minted and stored in blockchain of crypto network which can be of any digital files like images and videos etc as they're signed using technology of crypto currencies each NFT have its own crypto signature due to that they cannot be duplicated which makes them unique thanks to such structure of NFTs they got huge recognition from people around the world and in large numbers they started creating various NFTs out of them many are valuable ones created by well known popular artists and celebrities etc due to that in short time NFTs become business with rapid rise of NFT market places which all increased value of NFTs immensely.

  

We have several NFT market places now to buy and sell NFTs using various crypto currencies which are available as Web3 dApps on almost all crypto wallets out of them most popular one is OpenSea which is primary choice of many NFT collectors isn't it? anyway at the end you use any NFT market place to buy or sell whatever NFTs they are connected with the crypto wallets like Trustwallet or Metamask etc which are quite cool but thing is they only allow you to open and connect to NFT marketplaces where you have to manually manage your NFTs everytime due to that you won't be able to track all your NFTs effectively.

  

In sense, most crypto wallets are primarily developed to manage crypto currencies not NFTs though current popularity of NFTs making developers of crypto wallets to add number of options and features to simplify usage of NFTs still they are not specifically designed to manage and track NFTs due to that certain people who are interested in NFT market to buy and sell NFTs or anything else usually want a app to manage and track NFT portfolio isn't it? In early era of NFTs there are no such NFT apps but now there is large percentage of NFT enthusiasts and collectors as there is huge demand developers created number of super cool NFT portfolio trackers.

  

Recently, we got to know about an amazing simple yet advanced that helps NFT traders and collectors stay active and up-to-date with latest developments in Web3 NFT market in real time though at present  RoverX is in early access which means development is in progress but in future RoverX may fix existing issues and release interesting options and features in future, so do we got your attention? are you interested? if yes let's explore more.
