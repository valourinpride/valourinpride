Every smartphone comes with it's own default launcher, home screen setup and wallpapers with no customisation option, this is why people who want to customise thier home screen and wallpapers install a third party launcher like Nova launcher to full-fill thier creative endeavours.

  

If you're willing to customize your home screen with your own ideas then you can use apps like Nova launcher, where you can also backup home screen setup and share with others, but remember making a fab home screen is not an easy task you need to have creative skills and patience.

  

However, for whatever reason if you don't want to setup your own home screen then you can search for publicly available home screen setups and choose the one which you like the most according to your liking and personal preferences, on internet you can find numerous amazing home screen setups created by creative people for you.

  

In this scenario, to make things easier for you we are glad to present you a app named TruePick's where you will get thousands of fabulous home screen setups and wallpapers uploaded by users like you for free so do you like it? are you interested in TruePick's?
