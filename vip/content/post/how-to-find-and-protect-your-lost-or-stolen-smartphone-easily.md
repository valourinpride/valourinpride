Telephone is an electronic voice communication device created and first patented by Alexander Graham Bell in year 1876 at first it is connected with cables and cords with capability of sending and receiving voice signals upto 3 kilometres which back then is expensive but as time goes thanks to Inventors and companies for personal or commercial reasons done many upgrades and updates on Telephone by adapting to latest technologies in that process we got wireless Telephone.

  

Motorola DynaTac 8000X is world first truly wireless mobile phone basically a evolution of Telephone that will not only let you do calls in your area but around the world thanks to pre-available telephone network infrastructure like telephone base stations for every mile with international and local roaming facility created by alot of companies but it don't have operating system basically digital software which is already available on electronic computer and handheld PDAs aka personal digital assistants isn't disappointing?

  

Computer is hardware based mechanical device created by Charles Babbage to do various tasks efficiently in 18th century that was evolved to electronic computers in mid 19th century at first they are big and expensive and by 1970s we got home compatible personal computers which are mainly Integrated with CLI - command line interface or GUI - graphical user interface operating systems softwares to do real life tasks electronically and digitally.

  

But, PCs aka personal computers are not handheld devices so you usually have to sit or stand in one position to access and operate them which is not comfortable that's why many inventors developed and released it's alternative small size PDA which comes with one desktop operating system with all almost all required options and features of PCs but what they lack is in-build functionality to directly make and receive telecom network based calls and messages due to that majority of people who want to voice or text communicate with people back then even now used to rely on telephones and mobile phones.

  

Even though, we got to see number of handheld PDAs with in-build feature to make direct telecom calls and messages without relying on Internet broadband but they are not available in full scale which is why telephones and mobile phones were widely used around the world but as said earlier they are mostly not Integrated with operating system thus you'll not be able to work and execute digital tasks of PCs on the move conveniently and comfortably.

  

Fortunately, In early 20th century we got some handheld keypad mobile phones Integrated with operating systems like Java and SymbianOS etc with inbuild feature to make and receive calls and messages etc but they are basic and not powerful or advanced enough to compete with PCs yet still you can install and run kilobyte sized softwares on the go which back then very useful and awesome.

  

Thankfully, Apple inc. a popular american PC maker well known for iPod developed and released revolutionary multi-touch display technology smartphone named iPhone released by it's founder Steve Jobs in year 2007 on January 9 that got super immense success after that many mobile mobile companies who are negetively impacted by iPhone used this opportunity to make business in that process many companies started creating thier own smartphones with custom hardware and software to simply use on the go.

  

However, iPhone hardware and software is closed source at first it's operating system don't have name but from iPhone 2 Apple inc. named it as iOS which is modern that is one of the main reason why iPhone go out of in just few years but as no one able to use it mobile companies started using many open source hardware and software to make smartphones accordingly.

  

Now we are in 21st century majority of people use smartphones over PCs as they can use them on move more conveniently but as you take smartphones with you to almost all places there is possibility that may lose it even someone stole from you unknowingly which is why foremost in order to protect your privacy it's always recommended to put security lock but that can be easily unlocked using softwares so for additional protection you may have to keep track of your smartphones.

  

Usually, smartphone operating system provide feature that you can enable to find your device on maps even remotely erase data using same or different email like for instance Find My Device on Android powered smartphones but most OEM track my device facilities don't provide most options and features they have limited options and features which don't even work when someone remove sim card or switch off smartphones that's why you may rely on them completely.

  

If you already enabled Find My device like  OEM features or options on smartphones yet still didn't able to find smarphone then 

you may have to report it to near police station law enforcement agencies who may be using your IMEI number or mainly telecom cell signals and triangulation to detect your stolen or lost smartphones but that may take time based on them which is why instead of going lengthy process it's better to takecare of it yourself.
