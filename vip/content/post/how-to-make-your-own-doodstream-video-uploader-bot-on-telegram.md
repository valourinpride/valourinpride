In this world, inventors and companies in mid 19th century build alot of electronic devices with integration of softwares like for Instance GUI or CLI based operating system computers or personal computers and digital cameras etc which have ability to do physical real life tasks electronically by using them you can easily create digital files to store or create physical objects in digital form for various usage purposes.  

  

Electronic devices especially personal computers and digital cameras simplified hard tasks by making them convienient and comfortable using it's technologies due to that alot of people around the world started using them to use or create digital files which they used to store them on hardware based storage provider named HDDs aka hard disk drives after that we got better and faster hardware storage provider named SSD aka static disk drives.

  

HDDs and SSDs are available in all sizes based on electronic devices which are widely used by people around the world  but HDDs and SDDs have limited storage capacity even though we have big storage capacity HDDs and SDDs like terra bytes still it is not unlimited storage so if you have huge size digital files then you have to get many HDDs and SDDs that's quite expensive and at the end HDDs and SDDs are physical objects so if you loose them then there is no way to recover thus you to make and  backup your files from scratch again.

  

Fortunately, In year 1991 Tim Berners Lee developed and released WWW aka world wide web browser basically software for personal computers that can crawl public contents of Internet due to that alot of people started creating different types of digital platforms to share them on internet using numerous programming languages but they used to host digital platforms on thier HDDs and SDDs and then share them via server on world wide web of internet.

  

Thankfully, many developers and companies created cloud storage and server digital platforms on world wide web which in back end use HDDs and SSDs but you can't see them instead you will get them in digital form with flexible options and features which you can change or customize to reduce or expand storage then simply host your digital files.

  

Digital cloud storage and server platforms are easy to use where you have to simply create an account to start uploading all types of digital files and then access them anywhere and anytime on PC or any other compatible electronic devices like mobiles and smartphones etc but majority of cloud storage and server platforms are paid and free ones provide less storage space due to that if you have big size digital files then they may probably won't work for you.

  

if you can afford paid plans of cloud storage and server platforms to expand storage capacity then it's fine but most people don't like to pay for cloud storage and server platforms instead they want them totally free for such people alot of 

developers and companies since the start of world wide web created numerous free big cloud storage and server platforms.

  

Now, we have numerous free big cloud storage size and fast server platforms from developers and companies around the world where you can host plenty of big size digital files but if you want to totally generate revenue on digital file views and downloads then it's not possible as most cloud storage and server platforms don't pay for digital file uploads so you have to upload them for free, isn't disappointing?

  

However, from past few years we got many cloud storage platforms which pay for your digital files view and downloads but incase you just want to make money on video digital files then there is Google's video blogging platform YouTube that allows you to upload unlimited big size digital files for free which is why most people prefer and like to use YouTube.

  

YouTube is undoubtedly best choice but making money on it is hard due to strict terms of service and policies where you can't upload someone else files as well which is why alot of people prefer and like to use other video hosting platforms to generate revenue on video digital files.

  

We have numerous cloud storage platforms that pays money for uploaded video digital files views and downloads out of them Doodstream is one which is quite popular from past few years as it provide 50GB cloud storage so there is high probability that you're using it.

  

If you're using Doodstream then you probably know in order to upload video digital files on Doodstream you have to use it's website which is ok for majority of users but some of them want to upload videos digital files on Doodstream from apps or any other sources which is not possible unless your are app developer with knowledge on managing API.

  

Doodstream provide an API aka application programming interface token which you can integrate on your app to access Doodstream features and upload video files but for that you need to have knowledge on programming languages and cloud servers which are usually not free so if you don't have them and don't want to spend money on hiring freelancers then you have to rely on pre-available clients of Doodstream.

  

Generally, clients software of digital platforms which have API token is common so not everyone likes to use app clients instead they want something else isn't? what if you can upload all your video digital files on Doodstream from social messaging platforms like messages it will be super interesting and amazing right?

  

Social messaging platforms are digital platforms build by developers and companies using many programming languages for electronic devices like computers and smartphones etc by using them you can wirelessly communicate with anyone through texts, audio and video etc comfortably which is why most people started using social messaging platforms leaving traditional communication ways in order to adapt latest technologies.

  

Now, we have modern social messaging platforms as developers and companies for personal or commercial reasons improved and increased features of social messaging platforms since long time out of them WhatsApp is favourite choice to large percentage of people but it has alot of limitations which is why they are from past few years shifting to Telegram.

  

Telegram is popular well known privacy and security focused social messaging platform with powerful and advanced features founded by Pavel durov and Nikolai durov which allows you to create several private and public channels and groups and you can also send all format digital file with upto 2GB size including that it provides an API token that you can use to make custom apps and bots.

  

Especially, most people come to Telegram for unofficial bots developed by third party developers using public API which provide extra features that are unavailable on official Telegram, anyway by using Telegram public API few developers created Doodstream uploader bots by using them you can upload video digital files to Doodstream from Telegram itself.

  

But, it is possible that you don't want to use someone else Doodstream uploader bot instead want to make one for yourself simply for personal or commercial usages purposes if you do then you have to know coding and must have cloud server which has capability to run your Doodstream uploader bot smoothly.

  

Recently, we found an public GitHub repository of Doodstream uploader bot for Telegram where developers already done everything by using that you no more have to know or manually do time consuming coding instead you can directly deploy and run that github repository on compatible and supported cloud servers, isn't cool?

  

We have numerous free cloud servers which supports automatic deployment of both private and public Github repositores out of them Heroku is widely used by alot of developers but they recently announced that they will become paid only platform so we are going to use koyeb which give 5$ free credit hobby plan per month that let you use 512MB RAM which is enough to create Doodstream uploader bot.

  

Usually, majority of GitHub repository deployments on cloud servers don't require database storage or we can say cluster but this Doodstream uploader bot require database linking as we are dealing with uploading digital files but don't worry we are going to get free shared database clustet from MongoDB so do you like it? are you interested? If yes let's begin.

  

Note : this method and process given below is completely and totally legal because here the official API provided by the platform itself was ethically used by some third party developers to get desired features and options with unofficial bot so if there is any issue araised regarding this then effected persons kindly may contact owner and host of this bot to resolve any matters, I just shown this bot working process purely for demonstration and information purposes, hope you mind it.
