Charles Babbage, in year 1829 designed and build world first computer named difference engine which is an automatic mechanical calculator that can calculate and tabulate polynomial functions after that inventors around the world build numerous computers using latest and new technologies for various purposes accordingly.

  

John Vincent Atanasoff, a physicist and mathematician invented world's first electronic computer named Atanasoff-Berry Computer (ABC) after that many inventors developed electronic computers by integrating operating systems basically softwares to increase and extend capabilities of computers.

  

Computers, in early 18th and 19th century are big and expensive but later on thanks to companies and visionary inventors they continuously developed computers due to that we got small size personal computers inshort PCs with new features and modern operating systems which can do almost all real life physical tasks electronically.

  

PC aka Personal computer used to be basic in begginings yet much better then big size computers but later on thanks to competition among companies in this capitalist world they gradually increased features of PCs due to that by start of 20th century we got powerful hardware and advanced operating system PCs.

  

Even though, operating systems are first limited to computers but eventually many companies started integrating operating systems on different electronic devices but operating systems on computers and smartphones are popular and widely used by people globally.

  

Now, in 21st century we have numerous powerful and advanced operating systems out there on internet for smartphones and desktops etc developed using numerous programming languages like C and C++, python etc and each one of them can have it's own user interface in short UI as per liking and requirements of developers.

  

Majority of operating systems are GUI aka graphical user interface based and most people prefer and like to use GUI based operating systems as you can see and access things easily but some people especially alot of developers use CLI aka command line interface where you have to send commands to see and access things which is bit hard to use for sure, isn't?

  

Anyhow, most PCs you can also call desktops and smartphones use GUI based operating system inshort OS and each GUI OS can have it's own UI framework like for instance Microsoft Windows currently use WinUI 3 and Linux and it's distributions like Ubuntu, Debian, Arch, Kali etc use GNOME, XFCE, MATE UI frameworks.

  

There are two types of operating systems closed and open source while on closed operating systems only developers can modify and change core structure of OS like it's GUI framework but on open source operating systems anyone from internet can use it's source and build ther own custom version of operating system with different UI and added features etc.

  

We have many GUI frameworks and each of them are developed using one or more programming languages according to it's operating system but the problem with most GUI frameworks is they only support one or few specific operating systems so developers in order to build softwares for different operating systems have to use and rely on supported GUI frameworks.

  

It is definitely hard to use different GUI framework for each operating system but as there is no option developers for more then decade go in that way which is why developers take time to build and release software upgrades and updates bit late if they support multiple operating systems.

  

Thankfully, on Dec 4th, 2018 Google released Flutter a cross platform GUI framework with that you can build softwares for both deskop and mobile operating systems like Android, iOS, Mac OS, Linux, Windows etc thus developers can convieniently make modern rich GUI softwares easily and comfortably.

  

Flutter is written in Dart programming language that has potential to replace other GUI frameworks in near future which is now competing with other popular GUI frameworks like Kotlin which is why Google completely used Flutter to build user interface of it's upcoming operating system Fuchsia OS that going to replace or become alternative to Android OS.

  

**[\+ What happened to Fuchsia OS, A operating system from Google.](https://www.techtracker.in/2022/07/what-happened-to-fuchsia-os-operating.html)**

  

Fortunately, as Flutter is open source GUI framework any developer can make his own operating system with Flutter GUI framework even though many developers already making cross platforms apps but still almost all operating systems as base still not used GUI framework of Flutter.

  

Recently, we found world's first open source desktop operating system named dahliaOS based on Linux that uses pangolin a desktop environment written in flutter which is an modern, secure, lightweight, privacy and security socused operating system that combines GNU/Linux and FuchsiaOS.

  

dahliaOS was announced on February 27, 2019 by Camden Bruce later on dahliaOS developers team added many features then released it's first base version on August 8 , 2020 after that we got many dahliaOS updates with bug fixes and more features due to that dahliaOS is usable but dahliaOS is not based on Fuchsia OS.

  

In sense, dahliaOS look and feel like Fuchsia OS as it's desktop environment pangolin is written in Flutter but in reality dahliaOS is not based on Flutter but the team of dahliaOS is working to make a desktop operating system of Fuschia OS which they didn't started yet but may come in future so that we can use FuchsiaOS on desktops as well isn't cool and amazing? so do you like it? are you interested in dahliaOS? If yes let's explore more.

Atlast, this are just highlighted features of dahliaOS there may be many hidden features in-build that provides you external benefits to give the ultimate usage experience, anyway if you want one the best flutter UI deskop linux operating system then dahliaOS is on go choice.

  

Overall, dahliaOS comes with light and dark mode by default, it has clean and simple interface that ensures user friendly experience, but in any project there is always space for improvement so let's wait and see will dahliaOS get any major UI changes in future to make it even more better, as of now it's fabulous.

  

Moreover, it is definitely worth to mention 

dahliaOS is one of the only Linux based operating system which has desktop environment written in Flutter yes indeed if you're searching for desktop operating system then dahliaOS has potential to become your new favourite choice.

  

Finally, this is dahliaOS the world's first linux based desktop operating with Flutter GUI framework, are you an existing user of dahliaOS? If yes do say your experience and mention which feature of dahliaOS you like the most in our comment section below, see ya :)
