Most people limit themselves to system launchers and default icons on Android, eventhough alot of apps come with cool and amazing icons but there are people who don't like default icons instead they choose customized icons that are better then default icons.

  

Now-a-days majority of Android users relying on custom launchers to set thier favorite customized icons offered by icon packs as many system launchers usually don't support customized third party icon

packs, but poco launcher and some other system launchers does support custom third party icon packs.

  

However, Icon packs should also support the launcher you use else it will not work, there should be mutual support from icon packs and launcher as well, which is why  you have to select only those icon packs that are supported by your launcher thus you won't face issues,

  

Incase, if the icon pack you like not supported by your launcher then you may contact the developer of icon pack to add support for your launcher, while most icon 

packs developers consider adding support to expand launchers as much as possible to increase userbase.
