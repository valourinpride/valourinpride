Black / White - B/W to color photographs - photos and eventually to moving B/W and colour pictures also known as films, the transition of camera and it's technologies over past few centuries is revolutionary thanks to continous developments and advancements from inventors around the world which are quite mesmerizing and evolving camera for future due to long time immense efforts of many inventors and companies around the world we from  very basic pinhole camera which used to capture B/W and colour photographs on papers and eventually by mid 19th century we got into electronic camera which used to capture photos and films on negetive reels and then by 20th century we got into digital camera which utilize electronic hardware and software technologies to capture and store photos and films in number of different digital formats known as images and videos, they can be viewed using supported softwares on electronic gadgets like PC and smartphones etc.

  

If you don't know what exactly is camera? then for you in simple camera is basically a gadget that based on integrated technologies can capture and store real life objects in physical form like photos or films and in digital formats like images and videos at first back in early era of camera it used to capture low quality and resolution photos and films but as time goes they were updated and upgraded in order to adapt latest technologies in that process now we got modern cameras packed with powerful and advanced revolutionary technologies by using them you can capture super high quality and resolution images and videos like 2K, 4K, 8K etc including that digital cameras are not limited to one gadget thanks to their potential over the years makers around the world integrated them on many electronic gadgets like desktops, mobiles, CC, smart TVs etc which are flexible and available in small sizes to simply utilize on the go.

  

In sense, now a days majority of people widely using digital cameras on electronic gadgets they by utilizing many inbuilt  hardware and software technologies mainly using hardware sensors like bayer provide unprocessed captured info of camera that will then get processed through software pipeline to capture images and videos in .RAW .dng format which later system software by using codecs can convert them into numerous flexible digital image formats like .jpg, .png and in video container formats like .mp4, .mkv etc so that you will get images and videos in compact size and mode to let almost all devices and softwares view and process them easily at the end device hardware camera sensors and software pipeline technologies play main role in output result quality of images and videos which is why based on requirements you have to get right ones of them so that final output images and videos will work for you or else you may face problems in future.

  

Usually most makers based on their goals and to adapt inbuilt internal technologies integrate different quality hardware camera sensors and software pipeline technologies on electronic devices the better they are the more amazing images and videos you will get as output result at present in 21st century majority of people worldwide using handheld smartphones over DSLR cameras though on most camera focused and premium flagship smartphones you will get such high quality camera sensors and pipeline software technologies they capture and process high quality and resolution pleasing to eye images and videos but thing is on low and  mid end smartphones you will most likely get mediocre hardware camera sensors and software pipeline technologies they provide less appealing low quality images and videos, isn't that bit disappointing? 

  

However, sometimes a lot of people mainly film makers and videographers don't want software technologies to process camera sensor captured info instead like and want to get unprocessed camera sensor captured RAW images and videos info as orginal as possible so that they get more robust details about them and can simply add custom effects and filters using external softwares effectively to make them way better than system processed one's, are you one of them? but thing is if you use smartphones to capture images and videos then as you may know most stock camera software applications use inbuilt camera sensors and stock pipeline software technologies which mostly don't provide unprocessed RAW images and videos due to that you have to rely on third party camera softwares to capture them like Google Camera, ON1, Photon Camera and Motioncam etc.

  

Eventhough, almost all latest smartphones by default can shoot RAW videos but when it comes to Android operating system powered smartphones you must have camera 2 api which was introduced on Android 5.0 lollipop in that you have to enable camera 2 api either full or level 3 to shoot RAW images and videos though by default most makers at present providing them on new Android smartphones but on old ones you won't get them but incase if you're Android smartphones does have camera 2 api but don't support RAW then don't worry all you have to do is enable level3 or full using simple adb commands with PC or using root methods based on device but thing is not all smartphones support full and level3 of camera 2 api at the end even if your smartphone have both of them still it may not enable RAW as few makers hide RAW metadata in Android Capabilities and Stream Configuration

Map you've to tinker with them to unhide and enable RAW, isn't that interesting?

  

Anyhow, even if you have camera 2 api full or level 3 and got RAW support on Android smartphone still you may unable to shoot RAW images and videos as makers don't provide RAW support on stock camera even GCam can only shoot RAW images not videos due to that you have to rely on third party camera apps like MotionCam or Photon Camera which are top free and open source image processing camera apps they can shoot unprocessed RAW .dng format images and vidoes efficiently based on specs of smartphone but the drawbacks here is they provide .dng RAW format files which are huge in size like just few seconds of video can be like in giga bytes including that though they are pretty good RAW camera apps but lacking many required things and they're not specifically developed for proffesional film making if  you're into that then it's better to choose some way better camera app to shoot RAW images and videos effectively.

  

Recently, we got to know about one super cool feature rich modern professional video camera app named mcpro24fps which specifically developed to shoot unprocessed RAW videos in HLG / HDR10 HDR, 24 fps, 25 fps, 30 fps, 60 fps as well as in 10 bit on some supported devices with upto 500 mbps bitrate and support for all resolutions specified in Camera2 API but it don't use RAW frames and don't record in .dng format instead in video container formats like x264 AVC and x265 HEVC yet over the top it is considered as RAW video camera as it shoots gray log flat unprocessed videos and minimizes loss of colors and light curves etc which tries to keep orginal camera sensor info as much as possible so that you will get more details on the videos including that it has  seamless integration with LUTs where you can use existing or make custom LUTs as per needs and capabilities of smartphone which are basically colour grading configs 

to use in post-production of videos and make them as you like including that you will get many amazing tools to shoot best cinematic videos, so do you like it? are you interested? if yes let's explore more.
