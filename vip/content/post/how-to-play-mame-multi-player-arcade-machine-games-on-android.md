In the world, people used to play various types of in door and out door games but when inventors around the world started inventing many revolutionary machines in that process we got electric computers at first they're big and expensive but later on since year 1960s companies for personal or commercial reasons keep on reducing size with integrating of CLI ka command line interface and GUI aka graphical user interface basically softwares due to that we got electronic computers where you can play cool digital video games.

  

The softwares available on computer are in digital format can be seen on monitor developed using various programming languages that can do designated tasks which is even capable to play games that's why in year 1962 inventor Stephen Russell developed Space War which is assumed to be world's first true digital video game but as large percentage of people can't afford and don't know about computers due to that computer video games are limited to some people and companies like IBM.

  

Fortunately, In year 1971 inventors Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney under Syzygy engineering company manufactured and released world's first commercial electric arcade machine which is huge and costly but designed to occupy less space and let you play computer games so many retail stores, gaming saloons back then started setting up electric arcade game machines with pay and use model, amazing isn't?

  

The main speciality of electric arcade machines was it will let anyone play digital video games for few bucks due to that alot of people begin using even got addicted to electric arcade machines video games so with it's on growing popularity and every day increase in demand and userbase many offline stores which setup electric arcade machine were able to generate income with satisfactory profits.

  

Thankfully, electric arcade machines got worldwide commercial success and as there demand for them many companies in just span of decade competed with each other then manufactured and released thier own design hardware and software arcade video gaming machines in the process we got electronic arcade machines with long list of arcade video games to boost enjoyment further.

  

But, there are few drawbacks in electric or electronic arcade video game machines like they are not one time purchase you have to drop coins to use every time that's boring isn't? and it's not home compatible which people don't like and due to that not everyone able to use arcade video game machines so to fix this back in year 1972 

Magnavox company manufactured and  released world's first commercial home video game console named The odyssey.  

  

Electronic home video game consoles are one time purchase which are quite small in size thus they occupy less space to fit anywhere which can be connected to television to play plenty of video games provided by company at your convenience and comfortable zone any time and any where due to that many users of arcade video game machines eventually shifted to home console video games.

  

Even though, In begginings home video 

game are basic but it gone through alot of advancements to upgrade adapting to latest technologies accordingly due to that now we have numerous modern home video game consoles with powerful hardware and software which have in-built support to play high definition heavy size resources digital video games like Sony's PlayStation and Microsoft Xbox series.

  

Modern home video game console are undoubtedly amazing with utilisation of additional technologies like mixed reality handset you can totally immerse yourself into a new virtual world that you feel like real for sure but still some people may be because of curiosity or nostalgia reasons want to play arcade machine video games.

  

Now, we are in 21th century so it's really hard to get arcade video game machines as companies stopped making and selling them and almost all stores removed arcade video game machines and shifted to modern video game consoles so you can't buy new ones but there are several websites where you may purchase few used classic arcade video game machines with no guarantee of availability.

  

However, currently used arcade video game machines are super expensive as they are rare that you may buy if you're an collector else it's not worthy to get them instead you can play almost all arcade machine video games on computers and smartphones using emulators softwares but most of them are un-official ones 

  

PCs aka personal computers and smartphones can't directly run arcade machine video games due to hardware and software differences and limitations with system restrictions but emulators can play arcade machine video games as they sideload them in virtual environment of the software like nutshell or VirtualBox. 

  

In sense, emulator work like an operating system for arcade video game machine but right now majority of emulators are unofficial developed by numerous third party developers around the world who emulate hardware of arcade video game machine or home video game consoles in to software format compatible by personal and smartphones which is hard thus it will take long time to make perfect one.

  

Especially, third party developers don't get any help or support from official makers of arcade video game machines or consoles in making unofficial emulators due to that they have to implement and write and check alot of code and files with regular debugging and fixing bugs reported by users when they are playing video games which is why unofficial emulators stay in early access phase for long time.

  

In order to speed up development of unofficial video game emulators third party developers are publicly released it's code as free and open source on popular development platforms like GitHub and GitLab etc via public repositores where

interested developers through web can contribute code to add new features or remove existing ones and also improve through fixing bugs etc due to that now we're getting faster stable releases.

  

Generally, PCs are more compatible with unofficial video game emulators thanks to it's advanced hardware and software majority of third party developers choose and focus on it but smartphones which came to replace keypad mobile phones has potential and capability to do almost all tasks of PC in it's way so for more then a decade third party developers working and releasing numerous unofficial video game emulators for smartphones as well.

  

We have big list of supported unofficial video game emulators available for smartphones but some of them supported by PC are not available on smartphones for several reasons mainly because of smartphone hardware and software is not advanced and powerful enough to support and play new modern home video game consoles like PS3, PS4 and PS5 etc.

  

Smartphones are upgrading rapidly to reach the level of personal computers in all sectors and third party developers also working hard to get all possible unofficial video game emulators on smartphones so in future very soon we may get unofficial emulators that are currently only available on personal computers until then we have no choice other then to use existing old  home video game unofficial emulators.

  

Anyhow, In case of arcade machine video games they are pretty old and basic due to that third party developers are efficiently able to create many stable unofficial emulators with numerous options and features for smartphones as we have big storage and memory to play any arcade machine video games smoothly.

  

Recently, we found an free and open source retro arcade video game machine unofficial emulator for Android powered smartphones named MAME4droid by David Valdeita (Seleuco) as a port of PC's MAME 0.139 emulator by Nicola Salmoria that gone through numerous updates over the years which now has support of 8000 retro arcade video games, so do you like it? are you interested in MAME4droid?
