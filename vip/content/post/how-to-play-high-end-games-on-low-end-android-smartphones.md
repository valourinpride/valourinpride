I believe you may played games as majority of people around the world usually atleast once in their lifetime play either indoor or outdoor games like chess cards, ludo, cricket and soccer etc, since ancient times people created and played millions of different games for various purposes which are mainly designed to increase intellegent quotient as well as and for fun and entertainment etc.

  

There are 3 types and modes of games at present available for people, first one are general games and then second comes mechanical and thirdly digital games which we usually play on electronic devices like PCs aka personal computers and smartphones while 3 of them generally require physical and mental activity, back then a century back most people around the world used to play general games but since early mid 19th century some people started playing exciting digital video games on hardware based electronic computers.

  

Nowadays most people worldwide widely playing numerous categories electronic digital games but do you know how all this came up? In simple back in year 1962 Steve Russell created world's first moving graphics video game named SpaceWar which is basically digital software created using number of programming languages that will run on electronic computers.

  

Games, the digital ones are basically moving graphics which are softwares as pre-programmed provides virtual digital environment with digital characters and obects etc on certain theme and all of them are usually in visible digital format thus you can simply run and see to control positions using keyboards or joysticks etc  designed and developed accordingly to work on monitor display electronic devices like computers, isn't that super cool?

  

Fortunately, after SpaceWar many inventors created number of different theme video games but the problem here is back then electronic computers are super expensive and big due to that not everyone can afford and arrange space to fit them in homes but most of them really want to play computers to fullfill their wishes there is ComputerSpace.

  

ComputerSpace is a digital arcade machine to play electronic computer digital video games created back in year 1971 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney as Syzygy Engineering which is less expensive but it's designed for offline store with pay and use business model and system so in order to use that you have to pay or drop coins isn't that simple which is why many people eventually started using it pretty immensely. 

  

But, In the end for whatever reasons ComputerSpace failed commercially yet it's template was used by number of companies to make their own custom better digital arcade machines due to that most people shifted to them but they have few drawbacks like in order to play them you to go offline stores wherever available which is not always possible and they are totally gaming centric so you can do other stuff on them, isn't that dissapointing?

  

Thankfully, In year 1972 to replace the arcade video game machines, Magnavox company developed and released The Odyssey home video game consoles which is less expensive that you can connect to Television to play video games anytime in home or anywhere else conveniently and comfortably but home video game consoles are also gaming centric which not everyone like and prefer to fix this there are personal computers.

  

PCs aka personal computers are small size home compatible which are evolution of electronic and mechanical computers where you can can execute tasks as programmed electronically and digitally including that you can play video games as well but with PCs is are still big though not huge so you can't easily them on move like walking at that back in year 1978 there are handheld video game consoles.

  

The world first handheld video game is Auto Race introduced by Mattel released in year 1976 which you can use and play video games on on move easily but at the end they are gaming centric as well so over there you can only play digital video games nothing else so a lot of people whoever for whatever reasons mainly due to limited functionalities don't want to use them eventually shifted to PCs.

  

PCs can play video games and also can install and run other digital softwares at first they are basic but eventually as time goes inventors and developers upgraded PCs and videos games due to that by 20th century we got powerful and advanced modern PCs and videos games but they are handheld so mostly limited to homes or offices to fix this and provide better way to play video games and digital technology in year 2007 we got smartphones.

  

Smartphone is revolutionary multi-touch display technology electronic device as it's handheld one definitely quite easy to use then PCs which is evolution of PDAs aka personal digital assistant powered by operating system that can do almost all tasks of PCs in it's own way which beside running video games and softwares like PCs can also make telecom network calls and messages like mobile phones and telephones, first created by Apple inc. with operating system named iOS then after that numerous companies and inventors created thier own custom smartphones which all are now used extensively.

  

Now, there are different hardware and software based electronic handheld smartphones which are powerful and advanced enough to play high resolution and resolution heavy graphics intensive video games but low end smartphones comes with less powerful hardware and software like storage, processor, memory etc due to that developers of games don't add support for them even if they do still they very likely won't work smoothly.

  

In sense, when the quality of graphics on any video games are super high then to process them hardware and software must be powerful and advanced enough to run them efficiently else they won't work or you'll find glitches and lags etc which is why to fix this issues and provide best possible user friendly gaming experience to users many companies created various hardware and software technologies to big extent optimize games accordingly.

  

However, if your smartphone is capable enough but developer of game didn't added support to it's old or low end smartphones then you can't play them or in case your smartphone is really not capable then also you can't play high end games effectively but there is one useful way to play high end games even if they're unsupported and has many limitations on smartphones which you can remove using amazing game optimizer softwares.

  

Currently, majority of people all over the world using Android from search engine giant Google a dominant operating system for smartphones which is widely used to play games over PCs so smartphone makers as per demand to supply them mainly for commerical reasons developed many exclusive gaming smartphones and gaming software engines without or with AI aka artificial intelligence technology.

  

AI powered gaming softwares tune and adjust hardware and software to improve gaming experience on smartphones but the problem here is they mostly available for high end smartphones even if they are available for low ot mid end smartphones still gaming engine from OEMs powered by AI or not are not super rich even if they do still if game developer add limitations or don't support your smartphones then OEM gaming engines usually can't bypass or do anything about it which is when third party game optimizers comes in place to take your mobile gaming to next level.

  

We have numerous third party game optimizers for Android smartphones but most of them don't provide all necessary options and features even if they do still very likely root a software like SuperSu or Magisk flashed after unlocking bootloader through custom recovery like TeamWin recovery project inshort TWRP to break into system level files which voids device warranty thus most people don't like and prefer except techies and geeks even if it improve gaming instead want safe and no root method to be in safe zone.

  

Recently, I got to know about an app named GLTools a feature rich flexible game optimizer for Android powered smartphones that work root and without root as well which is an custom graphic driver that improve your gaming quality, performance and compatibility extremely run unsupported high end games on low or mid end Android powered smartphones, so do you like it? are you interested in this GLTools? If yes then let's explore more.
