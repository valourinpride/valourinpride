Telegram is a popular social messaging platform created by pavel durov and Nikolai durov where millions of channels and groups are managed by content creators, but there is no features available on telegram to monetize and collect donations or offer subscriptions to followers, while YouTube a content streaming platform has required features to monetize content, so Telegram created a official bot named Donate which will help you monetize and collect donations even offer subscriptions directly from Telegram channel or group followers.

  

However, In order to monetize telegram channel or group you should have complete ownership of it, else it won't work even if you're an admin, and you have to provide bank account or bank card with national identity card for verification so that telegram will review your Telegram channel and verify it to collect donations and offer subscriptions etc.

  

Recently, @donate telegram bot also added support for TON so that you can receive donations to TON wallet, telegram open network aka TON is an blockhain based crypto currency that was previously developed by telegram founders pavel durvov and nikoloi durov together in year 2018 but in Dec 2020 Ton project was accused by united states securities and exchange for security violation so project was abandoned, but later TON blockchain revived with Toncoin by developers who were not connected with telegram.

  

[\+ Telegram users can do crypto payments using Toncoin blockchain spinoff.](https://www.techtracker.in/2021/12/telegram-users-can-do-crypto-payments.html?m=1)
