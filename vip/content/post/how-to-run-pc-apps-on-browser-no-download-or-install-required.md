We are in modern and digital technology era where computers aka desktops rule the world with it's advanced apps which are capable enough to do almost all works but in order to run apps on desktop you first have to download then install them on desktop operating systems like Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.

  

Desktops also known as PC aka personal computers and laptops gone through alot of advancements and improvements over the years due to that since 1990's we got PC and laptops with powerful hardware and advanced operating systems that are capable enough to Install heavy resources apps and games.

  

Eventhough, In 21st century we have super advanced and powerful desktops yet when smartphones entered in mobile market most people started buying or shifting to pocket friendly smartphones as they are easily movable and user friendly for daily usages but still world is very depended on desktops to do heavy tasks because of it's powerful hardware and operating systems.

  

Especially, PC apps are way more advanced and powerful then smartphone apps due to that even hardcore smartphones users at some point has to depend on desktop operating systems and apps like unlocking bootloader or data recovery etc but smartphone can do almost all works of desktops in its own way thus most people not showing interest in buying desktops.

  

However, many people want to install desktop apps and operating systems on smartphones that is not possible few years back due to different hardware and software limitations but now we can install desktop operating systems and apps on Android powered smartphones using Limbo and ExaGear Emulator yet they are slow and can only install and run limited desktops apps.

So, most people don't show interest in running deskop operating systems or apps on PC Emulators available for Android because of glitches and lags and for them there are some alternatives for instance OnWorks a online platform by using it you can run desktop operating systems and apps on any mobile or desktop browser for free, isn't useful and interesting.

  

But, the drawback with OnWorks is you can't create an account and attach your desktop operating systems and apps into it to use them later including that if you create a session and stay inactive for 5 minutes then all sessions will be closed thus OnWorks is not suitable for work or personal purposes and unfortunately there is no paid or premium plans to buy and extend OnWorks session time.

  

**[\+ OnWorks - Run PC and Android operating systems on browser.](https://www.techtracker.in/2022/04/onworks-run-pc-and-android-operating.html)**

  

Anyhow, recently we found an better alternative to OnWorks named Never Install by using it you can't run desktop operating systems as of now but you can run desktop apps on browser using cloud technology without or installing them on your device, isn't amazing?

  

Never install is amazing platform for professional usages with numerous standard and premium plans while free plan offers unlimited usage with 1 hour session length even though you can only create 1 app and Never install auto close that session after 7 minutes of inactivity yet Never install will save all your works thus you can access them again when ever required for free.

  

By default, Never install Workspace on free plan has 2vCPU, 4GB memory and 5GB storage that is enough for basic usage purposes but in case if you want to use Never Install for work purposes then you can upgrade to standard or premium paid plans and you can also invite people via email address to collaborate on your Workspaces just like Google docs.

  

Note : Never install has adaptive streaming feature that will check your internet connection speed every 30 mins and based on that the resolution of app stream will be set for ex : if you want desktop apps at high resolution then make sure you have atleast minimum 10 to 15 mbps internet speed as if you have low internet speed then app resolution will be low as well, so do you like it? are you ready to explore more? If yes let's get started.
