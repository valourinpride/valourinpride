Internet is network of computers developed by ARPANET aka Advanced Research Projects Agency Network back in 1969 to move data on network between computers for communication purposes at first they sent one message between two ARPANET computers but back then internet didn't have standard protocol for communication with each other which is why in year January 1, 1983 a new way of communication protocol released named TCP/IP - Transfer Protocol / Internetwork protocol that was widely used now.

However, Internet used to be private so in order to use it and communicate between computers you have to get manual access from another computer due to that usages are limited but back in year 1991 inventor Tim Berners Lee released WWW aka world wide web browser basically a software for computers that can crawl public contents of internet and published the world's first digital platform known as website named info.cern.ch on August 6, 1991 after that people around the world started creating websites and blogs to share on internet and see on WWW - world wide web.

On world wide web of internet majority of people and companies used to make basic websites and blogs using programming languages like HTML which is known as initial version of world wide web named Web 1.0 at that time people used to host websites and blogs on computer hardware but later in early 20th century people begin using numerous programming languages to develop better advanced and powerful digital platforms and alot of them started hosting them on centralised cloud servers provided by individuals and companies.

  

Cloud servers also use real hardware like hardware and memory with softwares in back end to store digital platforms data and publicize them on internet but you can't see them instead companies will provide them in digital form on websites where you have to register to create an account then host your digital platforms publicly on internet that can cost money but it's convenient and comfortable.

Fortunately, almost everyone in web 2.0 era shifted to cloud servers as they are simple and flexible which you can access anywhere and they provide alot of options and features with security to handle alot of visitors and protect your digital platforms from DDos attacks and virus etc but the only drawback of cloud servers in web 2.0 era is they are centralized managed by one or more companies who can access your personal data without your permission for personal or commercial reasons.

  

Especially, centralized cloud servers are mainly targeted and exploited by hackers to access personal data of users and publish or sell them on Internet or dark web for any reasons even though most centralized servers use top security and privacy protocols yet they are bypassed on centralised cloud servers which is why we are upgrading to Web 3.0.

Web 3.0 is upgrade of Web 2.0 and  decentralization of Internet where digital platforms are encrypted and hosted on numerous decentralized servers provided by company or individuals thus it will be censorship resistant with no down time including that you will get best security and privacy as hackers and country law enforcements can't easily trace your data and take down your digital platforms.

  

Bitcoin is decentralized crypto currency founded by anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto in year 2009 that was based on concept of Web3 to replace fiat currency and middle mans like banks and provide better privacy and security as the price of bitcoin is volatile because it is based on buy and sells like stocks and in order to transact Bitcoin it has to verified by mining via electronic computers thus no one can do foul play for complete full fledged reliability and safety.

  

Thankfully, after Bitcoin we got many numerous crypto currencies and digital platforms based on concept of Web3 especially since past few years thanks to Web3 and crypto currency enthusiasts like DeFi - decentralized finance, exchanges, domains, browsers, VPNs etc known as dApps to make full Web3 decentralized  Internet as soon as possible.

Now, alot of companies and people gradually started adapting to Web3 by using decentralized servers and making Web3 digital platforms and software for security and privacy of users even though Web3 platforms are secure and better then Web 2.0 yet in order to use them you have to submit personal details like Email and Phone number to register like in Web 2.0 which will go through companies due to that Web3 is not yet full decentralized to fix that Twitter founder coined Web5.

  

Generally, digital platforms available out there on world wide web of internet ask personal details for verification purposes to confirm you're real person not bot back in Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 digital platforms used to simply collect personal details to verify and store them on centralized cloud servers which are less secure then Web3.

  

On Web3 platforms your submitted personal data wiill go through developer or companies but once it pass through after verification your personal data will be encrypted and stored on decentralized servers thus hackers can't exploit and  access them yet still your personal data is visible to Web3 platform providers thus you won't get full privacy and security.

  

Jack Dorsey founder of popular and well known micro-blogging platforms who recently stepped down as CEO coined Web5 for decentralization of identity and storage based on Bitcoin where you can self verify your personal data to use decentralized platforms due to that no one see or misuse your personal details.

  

Web5 uses standards of Web 3 but for extra decentralization and remove centralized companies and agencies it is based on Bitcoin concept like once you submit personal details it will verified by individuals validitors not companies using decentralized wallets, web nodes and web apps isn't cool and useful?

  

In sense, the ownership of personal details will be with you not centralized entities using wallets which will works as agents to provide decentralized identity where

your identity details will be stored on your personal decentralized node aka server thus you don't have to create personal profile for verification purposes to manage connection of digital platforms and apps.

  

Even though, Web5 definitely work for decentralization of personal data on apps but it may won't work on all Web2 and Web3 digital platforms mainly government related ones where you personal data has  has submitted in written form to totally verifiy and provide state services which they store them on decentralized servers for later usages in future.

  

In case, of private apps not linked with government where you personal data is merely required for verification purposes over there Web5 self sovereign wallet decentralized identity will work like to locally validate then import or apply same settings for Instance music or movie playlists etc to save time.

  

So, majority of private apps and digital platforms may not accept Web5 decentralized identity based verification as most apps especially from companies require personal data of users to provide personalized advertisements or offers even for  bugs report and feedbacks etc.

  

But, Web5 is early stage thas potential and capability which is in currently in constant development to make required changes and modifications for improvisation as of now Web5 self decentralized identity and server will surely work on open source apps hosted on decentralized cloud servers with no privacy voilating terms of service and data breach trackers.

  

Finally, this is Web5 an upgrade of Web3 decentralized internet based on popular and well proof of stake crypto currency Bitcoin, are you an existing user of Web5 app or digital platform? If yes do say your experience and mention why you like the concept of Web5 in our comment section below see ya :)
