Video games, have you ever heard of them? If you are from the 1980s era then you may probably know them isn't it? the first video game is actually created by Steve Russell in year 1962 named Space War which is basically software developed using numerous programming languages for electronic computers at first it is quite basic but later on numerous inventors by using thier creativity and imagination with skills developed number of amazing better video games due to that eventually the list of video games available for electronic computer increased immensely.

But, wait before we continue further, do you know what exactly is a video game? If you don't know then for you in simple video game you'll find moving pictures where you get digital virtual world filled with pre-set characters and items etc which you can control accordingly to play games like in real life but with joystick or keyboard on electronic computers thus you can play them anywhere and anytime in your comfort zone conveniently due to that many people who can't or don't wanna play real life games for whatever reasons switched to electronic computer digital video games, isn't that super cool?

However, In early era of video games most hardware based electronic computers are evolution of mechanical computers back then they're super expensive due to that not everyone able to afford them so they are mostly limited to huge companies like IBM even if you're able to buy them still as they are big and not home compatible so arranging space for them is difficult task for sure that's why most people even if they know about video games still unable to get them yet they always wanted to play them and to full-fill wishes of such people there is revolutionary Computer Space.

ComputerSpace is arcade machine developed by inventors Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney in year 1971 together as Syzygy Engineering which is specifically designed for offline stores with pay and use business model so in order to use that people have to pay or drop few bucks and start playing number of cool electronic computer digital video games on the go but for some reasons ComputerSpace eventually failed commercially.

Fortunately, the template and numerous other technologies of ComputerSpace are used by number of companies around the world who created better arcade machines and custom new video games accordingly by adding and Integrating thier own or by adapting to third party latest technologies in that process we got quite powerful and advanced arcade digital video machines which are awesome so eventually large percentage of people started using digital arcade video games worldwide.

Even though, arcade digital video game machines are right choice for people who want gaming centric experience, which is not available on electronic computers as it's integrated with many other required softwares but at the end arcade digital video game machines has number of drawbacks for instance in order to play any arcade machine digital video games every time you have to go offline stores wherever it's possible including that arcade digital video game machines aren't one time purchase and home compatible that's why alot of people wanted better alternative for them there are revolutionary super cool home video game consoles.

Magnavox is world first company in year 1972 developed and released home video game console named The Odyssey which you can connect to televisions and start playing pre-available video games in your home or anywhere else of your choice isn't that super cool? then after that numerous inventors and companies around the world for personal or commercial reasons and purposes created their own home video game consoles Integrating and adapting to latest technologies in that process we got much better and amazing ones.

Home video game consoles are gaming centric and less expensive then electronic  computers and arcade machines which are better and convenient to use as well so eventually large percentage of people who don't like and prefer electronic computers or arcade machines for whatever reasons shifted to home video game consoles that spiked demand of them to new heights so to supply and stand out in market in this capitalist world and make business most companies continously upgraded them due to that we got powerful and advanced home video game consoles which can play huge size video games smoothly.

Now-a-days, majority of people use modern home video game consoles like Sony PlayStation and Microsoft Xbox etc which are developed to play heavy resources high graphic intensive video games but some people to satisfy curiosity and mainly those who are from year 1970s or 1980s for nostalgia reasons still want to play on old home video game consoles which are unavailable now as it's makers stopped manufacturing them long time back isn't that dissapointing?

In case, If you strongly want and decided to play old video game consoles then you have to buy old ones from certain online or offline stores as they are rare you won't find and get all of them even if you got required ones it's most likely expensive which are not worthy unless your collector and trying to showcase or preserve old technologies so if you're someone who just want to check it out and play old video games personally on daily basis and want to save money then it's better to not buy old home video game consoles as right now you can play almost all of them on personal computers and smartphones 

PCs aka personal computers and smartphones are hardware based electronic devices Integrated with operating system basically software  which can't directly play home console video games due to hardware and software differences and limitations or restrictions, but many developers using number of compatible programming languages emulated hardware and software of home video game consoles into supported digital format software of PCs and smartphones thus you can play them on the go, fabulous right?

Most emulator softwares are developed  by third party developers thus they are considered as unofficial who are usually not associated with home video game console companies due to that in order to emulate hardware and software of home video game consoles into software they have to manually code and create each and every file then go through them to debug and find bugs themselves or as per reports of users while using software or playing video games which is hard and takes time that's why almost all unofficial emulators in beginning don't release as stable version instead stay in either alpha or beta access for long time.

In sense, un-official or official emulators as per implemented code of developers provide an inside virtual hardware and software digitally on it's software basically like operating system or nutshell to be exact like virtual machine which is amazing but not easy task for sure but in order to speed up it's development many developers mainly from past one decade relying on many contributive development platforms like GitHub and GitHub etc.

Especially, third party developers publishing their unofficial emulator code as foss aka free and open source on public repositories projects mostly on GitHub or GitLab etc where people whoever interested around the world through world wide web of internet can contribute and commit their code to do required optimizations and enhancements to unofficial emulator due to that now a days unofficial video game emulators in less time definately becoming stable.

There are number of advantages of being open source unofficial emulator to name few like for Instance as it's code is public you can go and check it to make if it's safe or not totally then proceed further to either use or not later on which you can't do on closed source unofficial emulators where code is encrypted so it's not easy to know if developer hidden data trackers or virus etc that's why if you want best privacy and security then it's always recommended to go for open source unofficial emulators.

The another important prospect of open source un-official emulators is as their code is in public repositories anyone around the world can use it to make their own custom version of unofficial emulators or even port PCs unofficial emulators softwares to smartphones and  vice versa it other electronic devices like Smart TVs and smartwatches etc by adding their own additional optimizations and enhancements etc due to this process we got to see numerous unofficial video game emulators which support and work much better then the official ones.

Usually, modern PCs are more compatible to run latest home consoles video games over smartphones as they are powerful and advanced enough to emulate them but from from number of years smartphones which is evolution of mobile phones with operating system that can almost all tasks of PCs in it's own way electronically and digitally also getting many upgrades to increase it's power and capabilities due to that developers also focusing on making new or port existing unofficial emulators so for sure smartphones may support all PCs unofficial emulators in future.

Anyhow, In case of PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 they are well known popular old and basic home video game consoles who once rise above Famicon due to that third party developers already build many stable unofficial emulators with numerous options and features for smartphones as it capable enough to play any old classic PC/Engine/TurboGrafx-16 home console video games without frame drops easily..

  

Recently, we found an free and open source unofficial emulator cross platform software without push ads and support for Android powered smartphones named RetroArch that has PC Engine/ TurboGrafx-16 video games cores which you can download and load games to start playing them, so do you like it? are you interested in RetroArch?
