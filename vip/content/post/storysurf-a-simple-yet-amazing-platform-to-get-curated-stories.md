Stories are basically formed up of words which can be written in any language by one or more people who are known as authors they through stories provide some information that has meaning or message for readers and each story can be written with various different context and words but at the end a story will be categorized into apt genres like horror, sad, folklore, fiction, politics etc isn't that amazing?

  

Generally, even if the words used formed up only few sentences with information then also it is considered as story but short one though most people around the world got used to big stories as they are very likely more informative than short ones but the thing here is not everyone like and prefer to read big stories instead they want to read simple yet informative short stories to save time on the go.

  

But, it is reader specific for some people 10 sentences are considered as short story and other may want even more shorter stories like 5 to 3 lines to crunch up time which is why for personal or commercial reasons since long time many talented authors around the world over the years written various genres short stories to not only get attention and recognition but also amaze readers worldwide.

  

Usually, few decades back when people  want to read any big or short story they used have no choice other then to select their genre and buy or get paper based story books from interested or favourite authors even now many people like and prefer to read stories on paper books but mainly since digital revolution almost all stories digitalized by people so you can view on electronic devices like PCs and smartphones.

  

In sense, many people using modern technology written and saved stories digitally which are basically software known as text that is way better then paper based books as text stories are digital not physical material due to that they won't get damaged for sure including that one PC or smartphone is enough to load many stories of any length or size which you can simply read anywhere and anytime conveniently and comfortably.

  

Eventhough, PCs come with big size display screen which are quite better to read stories but the problem with PCs is they are not handheld electronic device due to that you can't carry and use them on move easily though at present a lot of people read stories on PC, most people to read any stories like and prefer handheld smartphones, are you one of them? 

  

Smartphones are revolutionary electronic devices which are evolution of PDAs aka personal digital assistants which came to replace keypad mobile phones they can do almost all tasks of PCs though the latest smartphones has small display screen size like up to 7 inches compared to PCs but smartphones are handheld devices due to that you can not just carry but also load and read stories easily.
