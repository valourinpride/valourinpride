When you want to share your files with people you probably use cloud file or video hosting platforms but the issue with most file and video hosting platforms is they put restrictions on upload size and download speed even though they provide paid plans to unlock limitations yet most people don't like to use them as they're bit expensive.

  

Usually, Almost all free cloud file and video hosting platforms has strict policies on piracy thus if anyone uploads copyright content without permission from legal owner then upon report and review file hosting platforms has full right to remove copyright content on it's platform incase you didn't replied to DMCA notices due to legal reasons and to co-operate with law enforcement agencies.

  

However, there are many cloud file and video hosting platforms out there on internet excluding torrent sites who don't care about copyright content on thier site even though they get number of DMCA complaints yet they don't want to remove copyright content as people visit thiersite or app mainly to check and download copyright content aka piracy.

  

DMCA - Digital millenium copyright act is legal entity that has authority to takedown and block any website or blog that illegally hosts copyright content in most countries they send copyright notices to websites and blogs that has infringing copyright content upon report by orginal owner and if the website or blog didn't comply with DMCA complaints then they will either ban or block that particular domain forever on internet known as world wide web.

  

But, whenever DMCA blocks copyright content websites or blogs with in no time many such sites will appear on internet with different domain names thus it has become near to impossible task to remove infringing copyright content on internet as DMCA have to manually verify and check geniunity of copyright claim to proceed further that takes time and we don't have any other option to speed up thus pirates using this loop hole to thier advantages.

  

Recently, A popular unlimited video hosting platform named Pdisk mostly has infringing copyright content even though DMCA send alot of notices to them yet they didn't seem to respond to thus DMCA definitely going to block it soon but the owners of Pdisk didn't want thier domain to be blocked thus they removed copyright content to safeguard domain and silently disappeared without notice to users.

  

Pdisk is ultimate choice to host videos and earn money but since it's not available all users of Pdisk started searching for an alternative then we got Mdisk that has same features and very similar to Pdisk but the only difference is Pdisk don't encrypt videos and use PlayIT video player while Mdisk encrypt videos with .mpd format and use MxPlayer and SPlayer.

  

Mdisk is undoubtedly best alternative to Pdisk but as Mdisk encrypt videos most people don't like to use it as they can't always depend on MX player or SPlayer to play and download videos thus people who don't like Mdisk encryption started searching for alternative then we found Streaam that don't encrypt videos and has potential to become best alternative to Mdisk and Pdisk for sure.

  

Streaam is nice unlimited video hosting platform but it is bit different from Mdisk as on Streaam you have to contact support to create account and then once videos uploaded you have to play them using thier own video player named JetPlayer that has outdated user interface and gives poor user experience.

  

Recently, we found best alternative to Mdisk and Streaam named Xdisk that use MX player as default video player just like Mdisk and thankfully xDisk don't encrypt videos like Mdisk and but there is one drawback xDisk max upload size is 4000 MB while Mdisk and Streaam don't have any such restrictions.

  

Fortunately, xDisk has unlimited storage but your files will be deleted after 30 days and you can earn money by uploading videos just like Mdisk and Streaam when you get 1000 downloads on your xDisk video from any tier country you will get 1$, so do you like it? ? are you interested in xDisk?
