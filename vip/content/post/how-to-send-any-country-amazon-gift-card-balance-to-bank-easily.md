That's it, you successfully learned how to send reddemed amazon gift card balance and not reddemed gift cards by converting them to crypto and sell them to get bank transfer using paxful.

  

  

Atlast, this is the only trick available which can send any country reddemed amazon gift card balance to bank account, using this trick you can also send any other gift cards balances to bank, including that this trick will be useful for those you just want to convert gift cards into ethereum, tether, usd and bitcoin etc.

  

  

Overall, this trick is pretty easy and simple, however paxful is little slow and laggy, if you don't have fast internet connection then you may not even able to fully open site, it can take alot of time so I think paxful need alot of optimization so that it can work even in low network connection, even though user interface is modern still it has space for alot of improvement, paxful can choose any other template to make that possible, let's wait and see paxful can get major UI changes to give better user experience in future.

  

Moreover, it is worth to mention once you register on Paxful, it will ask you to enter and remember security questions, kindly note them somewhere safe, because if you forget them you can't reset phone number, email and reset password, if you want to reset them then you have to contact support and they ask you to verify your account by asking details, it can take upto 10 days, so be cautious.

  

Finally, this is how you can send amazon reddemed gift cards and not reddemed gift cards balance to bank account using paxful.com, do you like this trick? have you ever tried this trick before?
