Mobiles came along way now they have gone through rapid advancements over the years mainly since 20th century thanks to immense research and development of companies thought smartphones aka mobiles which we people widely use around the world are considered as evolution of PDAs aka personal digital assistants but at the same time of keypad mobiles so basically smartphones end up as mix of PDAs and mobiles in them you will find both ecosystem features due to that a lot of people now using and relying on latest modern smartphones which are not only better but also more efficient then PDAs or keypad mobiles to run whatever electronic or digital tasks extensively.

  

In sense, smartphone is handheld electronic device that at present time and stage has such hardware and software which is more capable then most PDAs and keypad mobile phones like to be specific in terms of storage aka rom, memory aka ram, CPU aka processor, OS aka operating system, GPU aka graphic processor and software etc what not in almost everything because most PDAs are now old and outdated thought there are few new ones but they are no match when it comes to keypad mobiles most makers make basic ones specifically with tiny size low end OS and apps simply to make calls or messages where is smartphone made  to handle small and large heavy resources data tasks that's why it's way ahead and

currently working as best alternate to PC aka personal computer, isn't that cool?  

  

The latest smartphones are pretty powerful and advanced devices but not up to level of PCs which are much bigger in size and capacity with way high level of hardware and software thanks to existing more then century of developements on PCs where is smartphones just entered in market in end of last decade yet due to on growing huge demand for smartphones almost all mobile companies as part of progress and to meet market demands worldwide increasing their specifications rapidly thanks to that it's fortunate to see nowadays we got such level smartphones which are not only able to compete with PCs on several sections but also can do almost all electronic and digital tasks of PCs in their own way, fabulous right?

  

But, at the end smartphones are sealed devices they won't let you simply replace and upgrade certain additional hardware parts like ROM or RAM etc unless you are skilled technician and able to open device and integrate things well where is PCs are open and quite flexible PCs support much higher level hardware and software so you can upgrade easily thought mobile makers continously trying best to make hardware and software of smartphones reach level of PC but they haven't reached yet so PCs at present are way ahead of smartphones which are capable of running huge heavy resources apps and high graphic intensive games pretty quickly and efficiently if you are into them and don't want issues then it's always better to use modern PCs over smartphones to run things effectively.

  

However, PCs are big in size with so much  space to fit things thanks to that PCs are flexible and support high level hardware and software but they are not handheld devices you can't simply move and use them around easily which is why a lot of people don't like to use PCs instead use smartphones which are handheld devices so you can use them on go but as they are small in size integrating high level big size hardware parts is quite challenging task though makers since long time trying to reduce size of them as much as possible to fit in limited space in that process they achieved remarkable feats still they're not enough if everything goes well in future it's possible we may see big size and capacity hardware in tiny size for smartphones.

  

Eventhough, smartphones not yet fully reached level of PCs but even with it's current level it can run many big size heavy resources apps and high graphic intensive games which are specifically developed to run on them according to hardware and software architecture of smartphones they are enough for most people but for some not who want to run PC games on smartphones which is not directly possible though there are number of PC emulators like Exagear and Limbo etc available for smartphones by using them you can indirectly install and run PC softwares and games but at the end due to lack of orginal system technologies you may find glitches or bugs while using them instead of going with such incompatible way it's better to use compatible ones.

  

What powers your device? you may say battery isn't it? but what exactly battery power up on device it basically power up device hardware and software right? and then each hardware and software parts handle different units of device to make it work as you do and like for instance ROM can store data permanently, RAM can hold data in background temporarily until it get power supplied, CPU processes data, GPU handle device graphics and many more at the end all the components of device work together to provide desired output which is why when selecting device you have to get the right optimized hardware and software else you may not able use device well even if you want to you may have to usually find some external workarounds for sure.

  

If you have smartphone and already or decided to use apps or games on it which have graphics then as you may probably know in order to handle them most device makers usually provide inbuild GPU with graphic drivers which are compatible with processor but sometimes inbuild graphic drivers that work as mediator to your gpu may be not enough or won't work well if you are in such scenario don't worry we can use custom graphic drivers but there are many different processors out of them Qualcomm Snapdragon is top open source and popular one which is widely used on AndroidOS smartphones that has its own cool GPU named Adreno if inbuild graphic drivers is not satisfactory and searching for better ones then third party developers created number of custom graphic drivers to level up graphics on Android powered Qualcomm smartphones on the go.

  

Recently, we got to know about an amazing custom graphic drivers named Adreno drivers which can update and optimize Adreno as well as opengl and vulkan graphic drivers for better game performance and stability at present it only support Qualcomm 64bit processor and some soc series so before you install make sure your device processor soc is supported and install correct version of Adreno graphic drivers and add-ons based on it or else you get troubles including that do note currently adreno custom graphic drivers only support Android 9 pie and 10 Q and in order to install that you have to  unlock bootloader and root device using v23 Magisk canary build or you can even flash on custom recovery like TWRP at the end this process voids device warranty,

  

In case, you're not sure what processor or GPU you have on device then check and verify details using device info H/W app and check information in system tab and then make sure to disable existing custom graphic drivers and install Adreno ones but if you mistakenly installed wrong drivers or even if you installed right one on magisk still device getting into bootloop then go to your custom recovery file manager and then go to data/adb/modules folder and delete Adreno folders it will fix issue if you flashed using custom recovery then to fix device bootloop you may have to re-install rom so make sure to backup rom and data to be in safe zone but remember though it support treble/non-treble devices yet still now it can't be used on dynamic partition devices it may support them in future.

  

Anyhow, once you install Adreno custom graphic drivers there is chance that you may face bootloop, black screen, screen flickering and certain apps issues etc that problem mainly caused when OpenGL and vulkan are not being cleaned to fix this you can install addon cache cleaners on your device custom recovery or you can also install OpenGL lite package that comes with seperated vulkan package at the end if you done everything right then check and verify using OpenGL ES extensions app if your OpenGL or vulkan version not changed then it may be happened due to lack of cache cleaner or outdated magisk builds so make sure to install and update them including that remember new drivers are ported from Android 11 when installed it may slow down or get some app issues so after first reboot kindly reboot device after waiting 5 or 10 minutes to let things go smoothly as much as possible, so do you like it? are you interested in adreno graphic? If yes let's explore more.
