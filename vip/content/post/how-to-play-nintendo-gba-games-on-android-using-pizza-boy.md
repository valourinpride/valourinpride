Generally, once upon a time like a few decades back people have no choice other then playing physical games which in most cases require additional players but later on in year 1970s and 1980s when industrial revolution era is in peak stage around the world especially in USA thanks to protestants at that time we got cool and amazing home video game consoles.

  

There are numerous home video game conoles but Nintendo seems the most successful video game company which is still market by using home video game console you can play 2D games on small digital screen using gamepad with single or multi-player isn't cool? so eventually people switched to video games for fun and especially because of busy life style in this modern digital technology world.

  

Nintendo, a well known most popular  japanese home video game company debuted in year 1983 with it's first home video gaming console NES aka Nintendo  Entertainment System since then they did alot of developements and innovations on thier new releases to upgrade and make them better then the existing ones.

  

Even though, there are more powerful and advanced home video gaming consoles like Sony PlayStation and Microsoft Xbox etc yet Nintendo is one of the oldest home video game console by using that you can play thousands of retro games so alot of gamers especially from year 1980s and 1990s like to play Nintendo home video games for Nostalgia reasons.

  

In 21th century, we have modern PCs aka personal computers and smartphones with powerful hardware and software that is capable to play HD high graphic digital games so most people and gamers switched to them and no more showing much interest on home console video games yet there are some people and gamers who still like to buy home video game consoles to play retro games.

  

But, Home video gaming consoles are bit expensive even if you can afford them still they are not worthy as now a days we have modern PC and smartphones that can play almost all home console video games for free using unofficial emulators to name a few PPSSPP, Citra 3DS, AetherSX2 etc.

  

10 years back you can't directly Install and run home console video games on PCs or smartphones as they don't support it due to different software and hardware with system limitations but now as unofficial emulators are specifically created for PC and smartphone operating system so by default support and run video games.  

  

Unofficial emulators are build by third party developers who are not associated with home video game console makers thus they won't get any support due to that third party developers has to work super hard to develop and check alot of times that take time which is why unofficial emulators stay at early access or beta phase for years even being open source projects on GitHub and GitLab etc.

  

PCs have better unofficial emulator support as they have more powerful hardware and advanced software then smartphones but now mobile companies releasing smartphones with powerful hardware and advanced softwares that are capable enough to do most tasks of PC in it's own way thus people and gamers shifted to modern smartphones and started asking and demanding unofficial emulators for them as well.

  

It is well known fact when there is demand they will be supply likewise we eventually got number of un-official emulators for smartphones which are previously not available on smartphones and only supported on PC but now thankfully third party developers created numerous video game emulators for smartphones.

  

However, you can't play one home console video game on another even on unofficial emulators due to different hardware and software limitations but there are some unofficial emulators which add support to play many home console video games on one emulator like Lemuroid emulator.

**[\+ Lemuroid - All in one emulator for NES, GB, PSP, PSX, SNES, GBA, DS etc.](https://www.techtracker.in/2021/11/lemuroid-all-in-one-emulator-for-nes-gb.html)**

  

If you're someone who never played video games on smartphones then you may don't know that home video game console makers usually don't make official video game emulators as it will decrease sells of thier existing products so the unofficial emulators are build without permission that's why third party developers don't include and provide support for games.

In order, to use unofficial emulators legally you have to dump BIOS and games also known as roms from real home gaming console else download and load pirated version from internet which is illegal but still most people and gamers like to play video games on unofficial emulators over home video game consoles.

  

Recently, we found amazing emulator named Pizza Boy GBA that can play Nintendo's one of the most popular home gaming console GameBoy Advance video games at full speed in 60 fps even on older hardware smartphones, Isn't cool? so do we got your attention? are you interested in Pizza Boy GBA to explore more?
