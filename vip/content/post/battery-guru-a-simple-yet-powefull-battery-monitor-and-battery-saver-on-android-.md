We definitely require good battery life on smartphones to get maximum possible screen on time or usable time on Android or iOS for daily works.

  

It is must to get enough battery life based on your battery capacity If you are unable to get enough battery life considering it's battery capacity then most probably your device software is not optimized or some apps are utilising more battery else there are some background services that has to taken care off If everything is good in apps and software then most likely it's charger or battery issue. 

  

We have Lithium batteries which degrade overtime so if you have a old phone then it is most common problem that your phone batteries degraded if your phone is brand new but you still facing the issue then it is likely a charging defect try to change your charger and check are you using company provided charger and right voltage or not if everything is perfect in battery and charger side then definitely it's a software issue that you can easily take care off. 

  

In today's life we need big apps for many purposes but they are loaded with heavy resources which drain your phone battery alot compared to other apps for example facebook app which drains alot of battery in compared to other social media apps just because facebook app is always in active in background which drains battery due to that most social media company's started making lite versions of thier apps like facebook lite or Instagram lite to save battery and data usage on smartphones. 

  

**Now**, First diagnose your battery, charger and check battery stats available in your operating system settings either android or iOS check which apps consuming more battery life if there are any heavy resource apps then uninstall them and start using lite variants of that particular apps else to save more battery life then use website of the app if available and add it as shortcut in homescreen now most browsers have that feature which is currently called PPA - progressive web apps which save lot more battery juice then lite variants of apps. 

  

**Previously**, we said software optimization  plays a key role for good battery life due to that most company's today releasing well optimized software to users if your phone company doesn't provided you with good optimized software or you are using a old software version then try to change or up- date the software for better battery life on your device. 

  

**Particularly**, network or wifi consume alot of battery if you are using network or WiFi which have enormous speed or bandwidth usage then it can be your network or WiFi that draining your battery life which you can fix yourself by enabling data saver or charging your phone in switch off mode. 

  

**However**, you must not charge your phone upto 100% or use until it drain to below 15 percentage it is good to charge your phone from 15% to 85% or 20% to 85 or 90% as per battery experts for good battey life. 

  

**Eventhough**, you follow all the methods mentioned above you must have to reset your device and put your phone in safe mode to reset your device software and phone to manufacturer state which will solve issues in most scenarios. 

  

You can alternatively unlock bootloader or root your device and then install custom roms that are specially developed for your device to extend battery life by XDA devs. you can check your phone XDA forums for battery based custom ROMs or support. 

  

**But**, In all scenario's everything with your phone is good but you desire to get little more battery life that can extend screen on time then you need a battery manager that gives you exact battery statistics and detailed app insights with accurate and complete analysis and report on your daily battery usage including some external features to extend your battery time.
