Money is basically something that we humans known as people in modern society psychologically think and consider as valuable asset which is used to buy products and services etc back in ancient times most people used to barter system where equal valuable products or services will be exchanged each other but it has certain drawbacks for Instance it is not always possible to exchange equal value product or service that's why majority of people back then started considering and using rare metals like diamonds, gold and silver as valuable money and they're still widely used globally, isn't that cool?

  
  

Even though, metal based money is way better and easy to use back then in times of barter system but eventually as people started doing massive business locally and globally thanks to sea routes like silk road on ships and then later on we got fast long distance land transport vehicles after that we got airline network airplanes due to all of them by 18th century business trades like imports and exports between countries not just rapidly increased but also strengthened immensely at that time metal money became bit inconvenient as if they are in large quantities then it will be heavy so you can't easily carry and move them to buy anything which is why large percentage since ancient times wanted better alternative to metal money.

  

In 12th century, China's Song dynasty is known to be first to issue paper based fiat currency money then before or after that there is no record of any ancient dynasty to use paper money but after long time in era of modern government back in early 18th century era United States of America introduced paper based fiat currency and declared that it has value and can be used as money at first most people doubted it even banks used to not accept them but eventually as there is no better alternative and choice almost all banks and people started giving and accepting paper based fiat currency money and people also begin using fiat currency money everywhere.

  

Especially, many countries inspired by united states of america started printing and distributing their own fiat currency with their own design and symbol etc then assigning their own value to it based on country economy for its country citizens at the same time diamonds and gold and other valuable materials considered as money which are still used by alot people but most people around the world since past few centuries widely use paper fiat currency as it's thin and lightweight you can exchange it anywhere and anytime quite conveniently and comfortably.

  

The entry of fiat currency money definitely further connected people with more local trades as well as escalated and boosted business relations between countries with more imports and exports etc but at the end fiat currency also does have few drawbacks for instance you can't instantly pay or receive big amount of fiat currency locally or internationally like metals you'll have transport it and as fiat currency is physical paper it can get damaged money and stolen easily, disappointing isn't it?

  

Fortunately, banks in order to protect and make fiat currency payments easily back in mid 19th century at the time of digital revolution around the world by adapting and upgrading to latest technologies introduced new facilities like cheque book and electronic money transfer to any bank using electronic devices like computers including that they even begin setting up electronic anytime money machines aka ATMs around the world where people can use debit or credit card provided by bank to withdraw their bank fiat currency from bank 24/7 all days, isn't super useful?

  

Thankfully, many banks either government or private ones to further simplify usage of it's facilities for customers created banking digital softwares developed using several programming languages to further simplify usage of bank facilities and then after long time when Tim Berners Lee released world wide web browser to access public contents of internet at that time banks also created websites basically online softwares which all can be accessed on computers due to that people were able get physical banking facilities and services digitally that surely increased usage of banks exponentially.

  

However, each person have different amount of fiat currency money based on work business or job monthly and annual income or salary and assets earnings etc isn't it? based on your money you have to spend on products and services etc wisely else you'll either overspend or totally use all your money which can cause number of troubles as if you don't have fiat currency money then you may can't buy essentials and fulfill requirements that's why it is always recommended to track your fiat currency money expenses so that you'll be able to save fiat currency money that will be fruitful and keep you in safe zone.

  

Usually, people back in ancient times even now note expenses on paper to manage money accordingly but it's not easy especially when you want to write a lot of expenses isn't it? to simplify this money expense management process many developers mainly since the start of digital revolution created digital softwares for electronic devices like computers and smartphones etc which provide number of necessary facilities by using them you are definitely able to manage all your money expenses easily on the go 

  

Meanwhile, Nowadays many banks providing features in their banking softwares itself to track money expenses which back then only used to track money transactions and you are not able to do anything else, though now we have many money expense manager focused banks softwares yet still at the most of them are specifically developed to manage money so by using them you may not be able to track money expenses completely.

  

Anyhow, it's better to use seperate money expense manager softwares over banks as at present over there you'll very likely to all utilities thus you'll be able to manage and track your money expenses better then on banks but in future may banks also include all required money expense manager features to provide way better usability and reach more audience.

  

Recently, we got to know about a feature rich and super cool powerful and advanced money expense manager app named Sprout that has 95% options and features ad-free and totally free which as in our test seems better then other money expense manager apps but we suggest you to tryout yourself, so do you like it? are you interested?
