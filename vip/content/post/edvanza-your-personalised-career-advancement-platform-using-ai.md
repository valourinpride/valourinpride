Everyday millions of people and students around the world learn new skills to get a job, work and earn money, now a days due to modernisation most companies require course completion certificate or degree to verify your skills and give you job based on your performance in test and interview etc.

  

However, some young students who got out of college and people who are looking for job or work don't know that completion of degree is not enough to get job as now a days companies looking for people who have skills and then degree is considered, for instance Google certification program and pradhan mantri kaushal kendra PMKK in india are such programs which develop skills and prepare students to achieve job.

  

But, this doesn't mean degree is not required as still most companies and government jobs require degree, I'm just saying even if you don't have degree due to advanced technology and modernization if you have good skills and talent then it is possible to get desired job.

  

So, kindly get a degree if you have opportunity else develop skills and enroll in valid certification programs to show them on your profile and approach such companies which values your skill over degree certificate and incase if you have degree then add that details on your CV to  add extra value.

  

Anyhow, if you have degree but no skills then it is hard to get a job and plan your career in this moden world, especially in india students are forced to concentrate on degree over skills and because of this most students come out with degree in hand and no skills due to that they face difficulties to get job or work in life.

  

If you're some one who is struggling to know which skills apt you best or you're unable to know which skills you have to learn right now to get job then you're at right place we recently found a platform named Edvanza which uses AI - Artificial intelligence to give you best personalised carrer advancement recommendations & insights to achieve your goals.
