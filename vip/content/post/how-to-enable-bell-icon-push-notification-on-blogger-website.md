Do you want to send your latest articles or updates notifications to your website or blog visitors automatically? It will help you increase daily engagement rate with your blog or website audience, previously blogger have feedburner email subscription service to send latest articles or update notifications to the blog or website audience but blogger recently notified regarding discontinuance of this service as feedburner going to stop this email subscription service soon.Â 

  

**Yes**, feedburner email subscription service going to stop at the end of may 2021 but if you are already using feedburner email subscription service then you can backup your emails from blogger before the end of may 2021, do check your blogger console for more Information regarding this matter.Â 

  

**However**, Email subscription have many negative effects on your website or blog due to that most popular websites and blogs already switched to bell push notifications which will send your latest articles or updates notifications to visitors if they subscribe to your bell push notifications service.

  

Feedburner or any Email subscription service have some drawbacks like it will spam the subscriber email inbox if the website or blog have large amount of articles or updates published in day which will cause concern among subscriber and they will have trouble deleting the emails and the subscriber eventually put them in spam or block or unsubscribe from email subscription service.Â 

  

**So**, Bell Push notifications are better and on go choice for any blog or website currently, it will directly send the latest articles or updates push up notifications to the subscriber browser as a notification which is better then email subscription service as said earlier, bell push notifications are simple and clean so subscriber click through rate is high compared to email subscription service.

  

**In Push notifications**, there are few types of push notifications but Bell push notification method is popular and recommended one because bell push notification won't ask the vistor to subscribe or give popup on screen instead give the vistor choice either to become subscriber or not in the home page with a small bell icon ðŸ”” due to this reason bell push notifications were liked by audience because it will not disturb or interrupt vistor exploration of blog or website.Â 

  

Bell notifications are safe unlike emails which may contain phishing links etc or virus push notification doesn't contain links until you open the blog or website so bell push notifications provide more safety and security to the subscriber including that bell push notifications won't be stored in your device they will just give direct notification to your browser which will be notified to subscriber phone notification bar containing little information of article or update which you can slide left or right to remove from Notification bar itself or click on the push notification to visit the blog or website. Simple right?Â 

  

**But**, there are numerous push Notification service websites out there available in internet so you have to choose the right one wisely so that you won't get issues later in future because if you don't choose good and reputed push notification service that was not verified or not even known either it will work or not Is doubtful so the Blog Or website audience may not receive articles or updates notifications to thier browser.Â
