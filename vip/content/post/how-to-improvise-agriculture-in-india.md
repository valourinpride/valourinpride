• No promoting agriculture and its benefits.

  

• Educating people regarding agriculture.

  

• Proving necessary benefits or encouragement to farmers.

  

• Providing decent profit margin for both farmer and retailer.

  

• Giving loans at lesser prices, and educating farmers regarding new techquies in farming.
