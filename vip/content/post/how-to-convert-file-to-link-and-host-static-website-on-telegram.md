Telegram is a popular social messaging app where you will get advanced features and awesome bots to do almost anything with best privacy and security founded by pavel durvov and nikoloi durov, Telegram is different from other social messaging so you can do alot of stuff that you can't do in other social messaging apps for ex: on Telegram you can create your own bot using telegram API and download files to Telegram using link, scan text on images using OCR bot, edit video and photos etc, 

  

Now, you may wonder how you can host static website on a social messaging app like Telegram, it is possible but using an unofficial bot named tlgur, where you just have to send your static website .html or .xml file to Instantly publish on internet, but there are few drawbacks on tlgur like even though you will get a unique link for your static website yet you can't edit url or add any custom domain to it, so tlgur bot is not for proffesional usages, it can work for people who want to show thier static website to get review or suggestions etc or to present profile etc. 

  

On tlgur bot, you can also convert video, photo, audio, and other file to public link and download them on Internet through browser or download managers this is another interesting and useful feature, which is helpful for people who want to send download link of a file for instance usually social messaging apps like signal, whatsapp, etc have file send size limit in such situations tlgur bot can become best companion for them.

  

How ever, tlgur is un-official bot of Telegram which means it is developed by third party developers, so you can't put trust on it even if tlgur bot assure you protection of privacy and security of your personal data and files, so kindly use tlgur bot at your own risk we just shown it for demo and informative purposes, we are not responsible for any personal and financial losses, if you still wish to use tlgur bot then let's get started.
