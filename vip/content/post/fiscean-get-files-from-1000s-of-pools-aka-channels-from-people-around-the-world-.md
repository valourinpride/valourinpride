People make .PDF .PPT .DOCX .XLSX .JPG .MP3 .MP4 for various purposes, usually these types of files were created to distribute read only documents, resumes, presentations, music videos etc as this format files are very important they usually store them in cloud storage platforms, disk, memory cards, pen drives etc how ever all these private files if not used will become useless and the work done by owner who ever created those files will not help others so if people can share thier files publicly alot of users can get benefitted from them.

  

How ever, people should be conscious when sharing files publicly because if they share unauthorised, copyrighted, strictly private files like closed sources then it will voilate laws and that can end up with personal or financial losses this is why kindly be cautious and careful so that you won't face any issues in future.

  

On internet, you can search and find any format files through numerous platforms, but there is no platform available for only files like YouTube for videos, so to fix this issue now we like to present a social platform named Fiscean where you will only find .PDF .PPT .DOCX XLSX .JPG .MP3 .MP4 files from the people around the world.
