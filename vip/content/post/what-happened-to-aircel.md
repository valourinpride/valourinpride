Telephone is revolutionary electric device patented by Alexander Graham Bell that will let you send and receive voice signals to communicate with people in radius of 3 kilometres but at first it used to be big and expensive due to that not everyone could afford them yet as time goes numerous companies globally started developing thier own custom Telephone by reducing size and simultaneously improving and upgrading features due to that by mid 19th century we got better Telephones which has signal range to cover several cities.

  

Even though, we got less expensive  telephones with comman man bareable and manageable costs to make voice calls in cities and countries but it's drawback is Telephone should be connected with cable and cords which is used to transmit voice  Telephones without them it's impossible to make and recieve voice calls that was not liked by some percentage of people due to that many inventors and companies begin working on to make wireless telephones.

Fortunately, In development of Telephones we got landline phones and then later on  partly wireless Telephones which depend on cable connected base station to make and recieve voice calls that's amazing but alot of people wanted complete wireless telephone without any external cables and cords or base stations etc at that time in year 1983 an american company Motorola inc. created world first wireless telephone named Motorola DynaTac 8000x.

  

Motorola DynaTac 8000x is revolutionary wireless telephone also known as cell phone and mobile phone with 10 hours of battery life and 30 minutes of talktime that's amazing after that numerous companies like always in this capitalist world started making thier own less size wireless telephones in connection with thier own or other Telecom operators who provide network of base stations in some cities or around the world to make and receive calls or messages etc for that services they charge additional money.

  

Telecom operators back then used to partner with Telephone makers due to that people have to use one Telecom operator provided by Telephone or mobile phones by default but eventually by year 1990s we got such fully wireless telephones mainly mobile phones with facility to use any Telecom network operators you like that immensely improved and benefited the  Telecom industry around the world.

In year 1991, Munich smart-card maker Giesecke & Devrient created world's first revolutionary sim card that you can simply add on your mobile phone which is quite small but it has ability to connect cellular land base station to transmit voice signals according to it's range capacity after that almost all telecom operators begin making thier own commerical sim cards which are now become necessary and widely used to make and receive not just calls and SMS but also data services amazing right?

Thankfully, in early 20th century we got wireless Telephones evolved version keypad mobile phones and smartphones which require sim cards without them they can't directly send or receive Telecom calls and messages etc due to that presense of different types and size of sim cards like nano, mini, and micro etc increased to new heights and many telecom operators also added several new features to sim cards.

  

Especially, when we got multi-touch display technology smartphones in this modern world of digital technologies the requirement of sim cards increased quite further including that it spiked and raged up competition among Telecom operators in that process we got affordable services through sim cards like several interesting value for money plans and offers due to that majority of people started using and depending on sim cards for long time.

  

But, In some countries because of various different factors like slow adaption to new technologies or lack of resources and money etc availablity of telecom operator services are limited who may unable to provide full fledged services to all areas in country mainly in rural areas where there are less people even if they somehow give almost all telecom services thier telecom plans will be quite expensive for sure.

  

In sense, if country have few telecom operators and with no full scale telecom and other related technologies then very likely the services provided by telecom operators over there through sim cards will be super costly but in developed countries even if they have very less people and geographical area still telecom sim card services will be quite cheap and affordable for Instance Israel a advanced technology developed small country with just few millions of people still provide cheapest data services in the world.

Now, there are number of telecom operators who not just provide services in thier country but also in other like Vodafone with facility to make and recieve local and international calls, messages and data etc in Integration with latest technologies but some telecom operators due to various reasons failed to stay in competition thus they either failed or went out of business world wide.

  

India is developing country which adapted to latest technologies like telephone and computers lately when compared to developed countries like america but once it reaches due to world's 2nd largest population it will take less time for the expansion of them which is why in india people mainly in urban developed cities quickly got telephones and it's evolved  version keypad mobiles and smartphones which is why india mainly in information technology sector stayed up to date.

  

There are many telecom operators in india from 1990s itself who used to provide services to landline phones then as time goes shifted to keypad mobile phones and smartphones but all telecom operators back in 20th century partnered secretly and scammed Indian people by providing telecom services with expensive plans like 1GB used to cost 3$ that to per month or annually yet still india people used to buy them as they don't know the actual prices due to that telecom operators able to gain so much profits for more then decade but in 2016 reliance Jio put an end to it.

Jio is telecom network operator in india founded by Mukesh Ambani from Reliance industries one of the India's biggest conglomerates released in year 2016 which provided 4G LTE services with free calls, messages and data for upto 9 months in name of offers after that they begin providing affordable plans like 1 giga byte data used to cost just 10 INR due to that majority of people switched to Jio that effected other telecom operators who got huge losses so they restructured price of plans to go in way of Jio.

  

The entry of Jio in india telecom network industry positively impacted not just india's information sector but also people and economy which made India as top #1 mobile data usage country but because of Jio few existing telecom operators got many struggles and losses like Airtel, Idea, and Vodafone etc out of them most india telecom operators survived who are now  providing telecom services in india.

  

Aircel is one of the most popular telecom operator in india well known in state tamil nadu founded who used to provide calls, sms and data services like other telecom networks which are super expensive like back in year 2011 Aircel 1 giga byte of mobile data with upto 3.2 mbps aka mega byte per second speed used to cost 802 INR around 8$ that to for period of 30 days which people used to buy but when Jio came into existence alot of customers of massively begin leaving them to join Jio.

However, Jio is not the main reason behind the downfall of Aircel it's Airtel, idea and Vodafone who back in year 2011 used to do alot of marketing strategies to attract customers which Aircel failed to tackle them due to that Aircel customers little by little in most india states even in strong customer base in tamilnadu slowly shifted to Airtel, idea and Vodafone etc.

  

Chinnakannan Sivasankaran founder of Aircel selled his stake to Malaysian company maxis who already has 74% stake as per india law enforcement agency CBI aka central bureau or india founder was to sell his stake and remaining stake is owned by Sindya securities after that in year 2012 they received notices from the Department of Telecommunications for not meeting radiation norms in base tower telecom network stations of Aircel.  

  

Reliance communications and Airtel was in talks of merger in year 2016 that didn't happened due to regulatory and legal issues which is biggest mistake of Aircel due to that Aircel got brankrupt and in year 2018 on 24, February they filed bankruptcy at national company law tribunal and then from March 12 Aircel is under under the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process so they are no more in operations now.

  

Finally, this is what happened to Aircel, which got bankrupt it may come again if it's founder or existing team revive it or build a new telecom operator company buying existing infrastructure of Aircel, are you an existing user of Aircel?
