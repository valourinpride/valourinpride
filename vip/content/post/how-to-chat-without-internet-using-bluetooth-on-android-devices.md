In general to communicate with fellow people short or long distances now in 21st century we use modern technologies and devices like smartphones and PCs etc which if connected with telecom network provider you'll be able to directly make text or voice based calls using in-built or third party apps but thing is in order to do this process you need internet data that costs money so people whoever don't want to pay for it use other ways to communicate with fellow people, are you one of them?

  

Majority of people around the world using mobile or wifi network data to access Internet and communicate with fellow people using softwares on electronic devices like PCs and smartphones but thing is many people still don't have access to internet data even if they do some doesn't have fast internet speed in their area or country which is why some people want to communicate without mobile or wifi data on the go.

  

Fortunately, we have many electronic devices and technologies to communicate with fellow people who are available at short or long distances like radio and walkie talkie which are available on almost all PCs and smartphones but thing is on them with radio you can only listen to songs they are not made to communicate and when it comes to walkie talkies most of them require you to have either mobile or WiFi data isn't that bit dissapointing?

  

In sense, now a days it has become bit difficult to communicate with fellow people wirelessly without internet mobile or WiFi data as almost all people widely using them extensively but on PCs and smartphones there are some inbuild technologies like Bluetooth and WiFi by using them you can communicate with fellow people anytime and anywhere quite comfortably and conveniently for sure.

  

Eventhough, Bluetooth and WiFi technolgies are actually developed to send and receive digital files between electronic computers but thing is at the end they can send and receive any digital data which is why numerous developers created and released number of messaging apps which use Bluetooth and WiFi technolgies to send and receive messages with connected users, isn't that amazing?

  

But, the main problem and drawback of Bluetooth and WiFi technolgies is they can only send and receive signals within short range due to that you can only send and receive messages upto limited distances like few metres or next room at the end bluetooth or WiFi network signal strength will be reduced as you move further and eventually get disconnected though the range strength change from each device and version of Bluetooth and WiFi as of now they don't support long distances.

  

So, if you are someone who want to communicate with fellow people who are far from your area then at present with Bluetooth and WiFi technolgies it's not possible but incase you want to communicate with fellow people who are available at short distances like in your room or next door then Bluetooth and WiFi technolgies will work quite effectively.

  

Recently, we got to know about an interesting and pretty useful app named Bluetooth chatter that uses inbuild bluetooth technology of your Android smartphones to send and receive messages between connected users without mobile or wifi data offline, so do you like it? are you interested in Bluetooth chatter?
