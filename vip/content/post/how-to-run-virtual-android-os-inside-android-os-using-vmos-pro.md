On PC, we usually run desktop operating systems like Windows, MacOS, Linux and Kali Linux etc but people use and install other operating systems as well especially mobile operating systems like Android on desktop using Virtual Machine or Android Emulators like BlueStacks, LDPlayer etc.

  

Most people use virtual machine to install virtual desktop operating systems yet it has potential to install mobile operating systems as well but people like to prefer and experience mobile operating systems using Android emulators due to amazing features and customization options.

  

We have numerous softwares available out there on internet to Install desktop and mobile virtual machine on PC like VMWare

Workstation and there are several apps on Android like Limbo x86 to install Virtual desktop and mobile operating systems on Android powered smartphones for free.

  

Even though, you can install virtual machines on smartphones using Limbo still it is not fully stable and you need to have desktop or mobile operating system files with proper settings to create and boot into vm aka virtual machines which takes time and you may face alot issues while using or unable to use them like regular operating systems.

  

Now a days, many people creating desktop or mobile operating systems virtual machines on cloud servers like Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, AWS etc then connecting those cloud virtual machines using apps and softwares like VNC viewer which require some coding skills and technical knowledge but the problem with cloud virtual machines is you have to pay hefty money according to specifications and usage of server thus cloud virtual machines are mainly used by geeks.

  

However, in case you just want to install Android virtual machine on smartphone then there is a better method alternative to Limbo named VMOS PRO where you will get real smooth Android operating system experience without lags and glitches etc, isn't useful and amazing?

  

Generally, on Android in order to install another version of Android you have to unlock bootloader and boot custom recovery like Teamwin recovery project then flash custom roms but magically VMOS PRO without doing all this process can install virtual Android rom on your smartphone in just few minutes through VMOS PRO app itself.

  

VMOS PRO virtual Android machine can't access private information of your real Android thus you can install risky apps on this virtual machine that ensures security and privacy of your smartphone, so do you like it? are you interested in VMOS PRO virtual Android? If yes let's know little more info before we explore more.
