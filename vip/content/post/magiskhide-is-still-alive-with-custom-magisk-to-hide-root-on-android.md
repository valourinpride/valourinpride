Magisk is a software for Android rooting, when well known Android rooting software SuperSu by Chainfire Team announced the end of it's development, developer john wu created and introduced Magisk, from then Magisk is considered as best replacement and alternative to not only SuperSu but for other Android rooting softwares as well.

  

Magisk is advanced Android rooting software which gone through alot of advancements over the years to provide most useful and amazing features, thanks to John Wu for such commitment, effort and hardwork on Magisk to provide one stop rooting solution for Android users.

  

Magisk has ability to pass Safetynet of Google, hide root, install magisk modules like Xposed modules, grant root access aka superuser access to apps and ADB and many more, however when John Wu the creator of Magisk got full time job at Google's Android security team he has to discontinue support for MagiskHide for various reasons.

  

MagiskHide is popular and most useful feature of Magisk to hide device root and run that apps which won't work on rooted Android devices, unfortunately the fact is official support for MagiskHide come to an end, so people have no choice other then look for alternative and thankly we have riru and shimiko to do the job.

  

Eventhough, John Wu tweeted that MagiskHide has flaws but stlll MagiskHide is working and effective method to hide root from various types of detections,  anyway John Wu eventually worked on new features on Magisk named Zygote, Zydisk and DenyList which can be used to only hide root for apps not device.

  

That's why, people especially geeks like and prefer MagiskHide feature but it's not available on latest Magisk releases, so they limit themselves and use Zygisk which is daemon of zygote and DenyList to run apps which won't work on rooted android devices, anyhow many people don't know MagiskHide is still alive on custom Magisk.

  

Magisk is open source software which means developers can use it's repository to make thier own version of Magisk, we recently found a developer named TheHitman7 who created a custom magisk where MagiskHide still exists which you can use to hide root of device and apps easily, isn't this awesome? If yes let's know little more info to explore more.
