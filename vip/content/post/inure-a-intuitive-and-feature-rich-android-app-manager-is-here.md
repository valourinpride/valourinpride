Which is your most used and favourite operating system? very likely you'll say Microsoft Windows for PCs and Google's Android for smartphones right? from past one decade and at present they're leading and dominating operating systems used in not just PCs and smartphones but also on many electronic devices like smart TV's or cars etc widely used by millions of people around the world to install and run a number of additional softwares either for personal or commercial purposes everyday.

But, wait do you know what exactly are operating systems and softwares? before we proceed further there is a possibility that you may be using them without knowing what they are and how they work etc am I right? even if I'm not, majority of people don't usually know full fledged details of operating systems and softwares as they simply install softwares to use on PCs or smartphones etc on the go.

Generally, most developers have to know about their own or someone else company or developer softwares in detailed with all technical details so that they can learn or debug bugs to fix or report them even they can analyze to get better understanding of them so that they're able to develop much better and bug-free stable softwares, this process usually not required and need to be known by common people as most of them install and run softwares until they get bored after that they likely switch to another software pretty easily.

Even though, persons who make or use inner components of software basically developers and programmers are the one who in most cases should know totally in detailed about softwares so that they can use them extensively but in some cases and certain events even common people may also have to know more details about them though not for developing softwares instead to learn and analyze to get better idea about them so that you're able to use them as best as possible or you may even use whatever gained software knowledge for the future endeavors, isn't it?

Anyhow, if you're here then probably you want to manage your softwares or apps right? for you in simple softwares or apps are developed using several programming languages like C++, Python etc which are developed for various purposes by skilled developers and companies by using them you can execute and run almost all real life tasks electronically and digitally isn't exciting and interesting for you?

In order to manage installed softwares either on PCs or smartphones efficiently you have to become developer that takes long time even years to gain certain level professional expertise but it's not always necessary as in some scenarios you may just wondered to know about particular software for whatever reasons or you've been asked to provide specific details of particular software that you may use that got bugs while using then in such cases you have to manage softwares yourself which is hard but adventurous for sure.

Usually, softwares contains numerous digital files and codes so you have to check and verify to manage softwares for that you need the developer skills who by using simple text editor or notepad can easily find certain code locations to get current updates or anything else but if you are not developer it's hard and struggling  to find important required necessary code of softwares isn't it? so to simplify all this process many developers created amazing software managers that are now widely used by most developers as well.

There are number of software managers available for desktop and mobile operating systems for PCs and smartphones and in each software you'll find different options and features as digital format of software change from each and every software due to different programming languages and it's components and data structure also differ as developers make software based on hardware of them for various different purposes and usages accordingly.

On desktop operating system like Windows you'll find number of feature rich software managers which you can use to know about each and every software data clearly and easily but when it comes to Android operating system though we have numerous software managers from both OEM and third party developers but most of them lack certain features and options even if they do have everything yet still in terms of user interface they're not up to mark so you won't able to get pleasing experience, isn't that disappointing?

Recently, we got to know about most Intuitive and responsive app basically software manager named Inure available for rooted and rootless Android powered smartphones with a lot of options and features that can be used by anyone mainly quite useful developers which will let you understand more about apps and with it's functionalities can amaze you.

Inure, is still in early access phase which means development is in progress so you may find bugs or limited number of features but eventually Inure may fix all issues and release more interesting and exciting features in future, so do we got your attention? are you interested in Inure? If yes then let's explore more.
