**[\+ The evolution of Computer to PCs and Laptops, Tecno Megabook T1.](https://www.techtracker.in/2022/09/the-evolution-of-computer-to-pcs-and.html)**  

  

On PC or smartphone powered by any operating system in order to view the contents of hardware storage on hard or static drive drives we have to use file manager softwares at first few decades back file managers available for PCs are basic but later on as PCs are advancing by utilising new revolutionary hardware and softwares we got poweful and advanced file managers developed using numerous programming languages which has alot of options and features with ability to open and view all formats of digital files.

  

When we entered in the era of modern PCs in that process developers and companies continously optimized file managers to the level they use system hardware and software power with storage disk write and read speed to maximum very well due to that modern file managers can simply cut or copy and move any size digital files from one directory to another in just few seconds even delete digital files instantly.

  

In sense, file managers work super efficiently on powerful PC else it may even take years to delete one digital file but that doesn't mean system itself is everything in order to view digital files available on your in-build or external storage file manager has to support different format hard or soft drive disks at the same time it must organise them pleasently including that file manager must provide all necessary require features and options thus you are able to do all tasks in file manager itself and don't use any external softwares.

  

File manager back in begginings days used to just view contents storage with only few options like delete, copy or move not even search feature available in some early PC operating systems mainly CLI - command line interface faces but later on especially since 20th century we got super modern file manager which integrated with alot of features and options they are capable to view cloud storage content as well that we are heavily using around the world.

  

However, when smartphones came into existence to totally replace keypad mobile phones which can do almost tasks of PCs in it's own way at first smartphones used to come with basic hardware and software like computers thus it's file managers used to take long time to move, delete, copy etc but later on in just few years we got cool modern file managers on smartphones.

  

Even though, modern file managers available on smartphones has almost all features of PC file managers and due to advancement and improvements they also meet the standards to perform any tasks blazing fast but still used to lack certain features for instance cloud storage that were eventually added by developers in the upcoming versions of same file managers.

  

Usually, each and every individual has different taste isn't? which is why various sects of groups used to rely on different file managers some used to like simple one and another prefer advanced file manager which is why many developers constantly worked on to bring and provide such file managers which are not just simple but also provide advanced features in single file manager with convenience as much as possible to attract all types of users.

  

We do have numerous popular modern simple yet advanced file managers available on smartphones for atleast an decade which over the years gone through alot of updates and upgrades to make them even better adapting to latest technologies but large percentage since long time used to like and prefer ES File Manager created by estrongs.

  

ES file manager is only available for Google's Android operating system powered smartphones since the early development phases of Android like 1.6 which used to provide plenty of useful and awesome features that are unavailable on majority of Android file manager for free in simplified manner for comfortable usage.

  

The simplicity and completely free features of ES file manager without any kind of advertisements quickly made alot of users shift to it and eventually become most popular and favourite file manager of millions of Android users to such extent every one used to install and recommend ES file manager without that smartphones atleast powered by Android used to feel incomplete that can only full filled by installing ES file manager for sure.

  

The reason behind that is optimization of ES file manager which is top notch due to that it used to even work on old Android operating system with basic hardware as well including that ES File manager since it's early releases used to pack numerous features which are not even available on Android smartphone itself like providing an in-build browser, file transfer, memory card and storage analyser, cleaner, cloud storage, downloader and many more.

  

Fortunately, ES file explorer stayed as most downloaded on search engine giant Google's Android market place play store  for years in that process they released many exciting and interesting features but at the same time converted thier totally free app into premium with in app purchases including that they started integrating unnecessary privacy breaching data trackers and also displaying poor spammy ads with click frauds for personal or commercial reasons which are known to be harmful.

  

Thankfully, Google after long time found that ES file explorer voilating it's terms of service and policies due to that they not just removed ES file explorer from its play store but also restricting installation of ES file explorer using Play Protect stating that ES File explorer is harmful as there is no choice ES file explorer developers latest versions of it on third party apk websites.

  

Unfortunately, ES file explorer never came back and unavailable on play store but the development is in continuation with added extra features and options may be for loyal users who fully believe in ES file explorer despite privacy breach allegations from Google and security reasearchers if you're one of them then you can simply get ES Explorer on world wide web of internet.

  

It is very likely possible that once upon a time like few years back you got into ES file explorer then liked and used it extensively but for whatever reasons later on forget about it then after long time may be now remmembered and want to use it again expecting same originality? I suggest you to wait ES file explorer is no more completely free and also has several advertisments so it's up to you.

  

In case, you strongly want to use ES file explorer then try it's old versions which are working absolutely fine or else ES file explorer developers created few more amazing apps named Foo view and file explorer released and available on play store which are more awesome then ES file explorer with no advertisements that can simply almost all tasks easily.

  

Anyhow, if you still want to use latest version of ES file explorer even after It's bit loss of orginality with in app purchases which seems like quite expensive and advertisments then you're free to do no one can stop you except you in this open web except you so do you like and interested in ES file explorer?if yes let's explore more.
