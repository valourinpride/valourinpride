Android is an open source project from search engine giant Google alternative to closed source operating systems like Apple's iOS and Microsoft's Windows etc for smartphones even though iOS is much safer when compared to Android due to closed eco-system and better privacy policies yet Android OS offers extensive customization to do almost anything without limits which no other operating system provide as of now.

  

However, in order to do extreme customization or restructuring of Android OS you need to unlock bootloader on new latest smartphones then root your Android carefully using specific guides made for your device from trusted developer portals like XDA that voids warranty and incase if you do anything wrong then you may soft or hard brick your Android device that is un-repairable sometimes.

  

Rooting is software to unlock system level access on your smartphone like superuser access in PC but it has many advantages and dis-advantages thus most people stay away from rooting due to numerous risks associated with it like prone to hacking due to compromised security and mainly editing system files unknowingly can damage your device permanently.

  

Even though, Rooting is risky still geeks and Android enthusiasts like to root thier Android smartphone for various reasons especially to install and use super cool root apps like Battery Guru, Busybox, Xposed framework, root explorer etc which provide amazing root features to extend or maximize system capabilities.

  

Root apps must require rooted Android device to work thus people who have unrooted Android device can't install root apps due to closed access to system level files but there is a way to install root apps on unrooted Android smartphones using Virtual machines softwares.

  

Virtual machines inshort VM is a software to install desktop or mobile operating systems without installing them directly to system thus you can easily able to install or switch operating systems in few clicks but most desktop users prefer and like to use Emulators like BlueStacks, LDPlayer etc over Virtual machines.

  

Few years back, VM aka virtual machines softwares are only available for PC but now thanks to talented developers they eventually developed virtual machines and desktop emulators for Android OS so right now we have some virtual machine apps like Limbo x86 Emulator, JPCSIM etc.

  

Limbo is undoubtedly at present considered as best and popular open source virtual machine emulator but it is not upto the mark of PC virtual machine sotwares still you can install any mobile and desktop operating systems on it's platform but you may face little slow processing as mobile RAM and CPU is not powerful enough to beat PC hardware.

  

You can configure and load any compatible virtual mobile or desktop operating system on Limbo emulator as it has support and efficiency yet there are very few .vhd format virtual Android OS files available out there on Internet for limbo emulator that to old and outdated Android OS version like donut 1.5 so you may unable to enjoy latest Android OS.

  

Anyhow, I recently found better virtual machine alternative to Limbo Emulator named VMOS PRO by using that you can install Android OS inside Android OS but the only problem on VMOS PRO is when they upgraded thier rom from 5.1 lollipop to 7.1 nougat we didn't find root enable option thus you can't use root apps on virtual Android OS provided by VMOS Pro.

  

**[\+ How to run virtual Android OS inside Android OS using VMOS Pro.](https://www.techtracker.in/2022/05/how-to-run-virtual-android-os-inside.html)**

  

Fortunately, there is a better and best alternative to VMOS Pro named F1 VM from X8 sandbox where you will get number of useful features with pip mode by using them you can install root apps as well on Android 7.1 nougut same Android version of VMOS Pro including that F1 VM supports 32 and 64 bit with no GMS aka Google Mobile service for extra privacy and security.

  

F1 VM from X8 Sandbox runs old and outdated Android 7.1 which is drawback as now a days developers increasing app SDK version to support only new Android versions but don't get wrong idea as number of popular rooted apps still support Android 7.1 and at the end we are able to install root apps on unrooted Android devices using virtual Android OS on smartphone without PC, isn't cool so do you like it? are you interested in F1 VM? If If yes let's know little more info before we explore more.
